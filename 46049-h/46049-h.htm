<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smaller">“&mdash;TO BONDAGE OF GREAT DEEDS”</span></h3>


<p>“That’s a dangerous fellow, Stuart,” remarked
Baldwin Carr, who had unperceived entered
the library, and, over his nephew’s shoulder,
read the title: “Thus Spake Zarathustra.”</p>

<p>Stuart Heron laid down the ponderous volume of
Nietzsche, and smiled up lazily at his juvenile uncle-by-marriage:
“Oh, we’re a depraved family! Not half
an hour ago I caught Babs behind the drawing-room
screen, reading Ella Wheeler Wilcox.”</p>

<p>Baldwin looked startled. “Isn’t that all right? I
myself gave it to the child; the complete edition,
bound in white vellum.”</p>

<p>“We’ll send old Nietzsche to be bound in white
vellum, and rob him of his sting.”</p>

<p>“And this man is just as bad”; Baldwin ignored
his nephew’s flippancy, and discontentedly flicked over
the pages of Bernard Shaw’s “Getting Married,” which
he had picked up from the floor beside the arm-chair.
“They’re both mad, stark staring mad, master and
disciple.”</p>

<p>“‘Enter Nietzsche mad in white satin, Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Shaw mad in white linen!’” misquoted Stuart; “yes,
we must decidedly send them to the binder’s.”</p>

<p>Baldwin Carr had come that evening to Carlton
House Terrace, to discuss a business problem with
Stuart, who for three years had been a partner in the
firm of Heron, Heron &amp; Carr, Diamond Merchants.
But, worried by the young man’s pernicious choice of
literature, he determined to let diamonds stand over for
the moment, and, instead, make an attempt to “talk
Stuart out of Nietzsche.” In view of which intention,
it was a pity that Babs had torn from her confession
album the page on which Stuart had made shameful
reply to the query: “Your Favourite Occupation?”
with: “Pulling the leg of my youngest uncle.” A
glimpse at this might have disillusioned Baldwin of his
belief that, near to Stuart in years, he was also near in
understanding.</p>

<p>“You see, my boy,” he began now, “these clever
chaps, these would-be philosophers, they put ideas into
your head.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Stuart gently, “I think that is what
they’re after, the rogues!”</p>

<p>“Well, but philosophy is all very well if you don’t
take it seriously; just mug it up for Greats at Oxford,
and so forth. But you seem inclined&mdash;you mustn’t be
offended, Stuart; we’re talking as man to man, you
know,&mdash;you seem inclined to apply it to everyday
existence.”</p>

<p>“Quite.” Stuart offered the other a cigarette, and
lit one himself; “I can’t conceive of a greater insult to
philosophy than to accept its logic, and refuse its
practical utility.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear lad, you surely wouldn’t dream of
setting up Nietzsche, of all people, as a standard for
your actions. Why, if a nation did that, we’d have the
world in pieces.”</p>

<p>“I differ slightly from Nietzsche,” quoth Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Heron; “he advocates the ruthlessness of the Overman
towards the mob; I agree with the Overman
theory, but I consider that his supremest ruthlessness
ought to be directed towards himself. Nietzsche misses
the value of asceticism.”</p>

<p>Baldwin said after a pause: “You’ll get yourself, or
other people, into a fine mess before you’ve done with all
this. Why, wasn’t it something of the kind that you
were spouting when it was a question of your career?”</p>

<p>Stuart laughed:</p>

<p>“Yes. Something of the kind....”</p>

<p>His uncle paced the room uneasily; he could not
forget that he had grave responsibilities of guardianship
to discharge towards this young son of Graham
Heron. Graham Heron, whose death had occurred
when Stuart was a boy of fifteen, had founded the great
diamond business, on which had been built up the
family’s immense fortune; had taken into partnership
his elder and younger brothers, Derwent and Arthur, not
so brilliant as himself; later, had admitted Baldwin
Carr to the firm. Graham owned a personality which
established him in general regard as head of the family,
and his only son succeeded naturally to the same
central position; more especially as Derwent’s progeny
were all girls, and Arthur elected to remain a bachelor.
And when school and college reported one brilliant
success after another for Graham’s son, then Graham’s
brothers and Graham’s widow foresaw a triumphant
future in whatsoever public career the lad chose to
follow up. Consideration of money there need never
be; a steady flow of good luck continued to attend the
firm of Heron and Carr; it seemed that the trio of
diamond merchants could do no wrong. Stuart, struck
by the Arabian-Nights’-like quality of their glittering
trade, had nicknamed them: the Khalif, the Vizier,
and the One-eyed Calendar; the last-named, unblessed
by a sense of humour, was never clear why he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thus be linked to such eccentricities as almanacks and
defective optics; but Stuart, even in his insolent
schoolboy days, went idolized and uncensured.</p>



<p class="tbpara">When he finally came down from Oxford, three years
previously, it was to find his future stretching before
his feet, a veritable slope of roses. He had been reading
for the Bar, and Mrs. Heron already visioned him as
the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p>“But I’m going to chuck the law,” said Stuart.</p>

<p>His Uncle Derwent reminded him that strings had
already been pulled, enabling him to devil for Sir Blair
Tomlinson, foremost barrister of the day; and that a
more promising start could be assured to no man.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” Stuart agreed. And: “I’m going to
chuck the law.”</p>

<p>The next few weeks proved but repetitions of this
incident, under various guises. Stuart had but to
mention a profession&mdash;army, navy, political, diplomatic;
and Uncle Derwent or Uncle Arthur or Uncle Baldwin
was able speedily to procure such influence in that
particular quarter, as to ensure their nephew a clear
path to the very summit of ambition. And Uncle
Derwent or Uncle Arthur or Uncle Baldwin had but to
mention such influence procured, and Stuart speedily
abandoned all idea of that particular career. The climax
was reached when, by way of a test, the young man
averred longings for stage laurels; and Uncle Baldwin,
two evenings later, strolled into the billiard-room in
Carlton House Terrace, with the triumphant tidings
that London’s leading actor-manager, Sir Michael
Forrest&mdash;“I used to know him very well”&mdash;had
avowed himself delighted to give Mr. Stuart Heron a
part in the next big autumn production, and the under-study
of juvenile lead.</p>

<p>“I told him what they said about your Greek performance
in the O.U.D.S.,” finished Baldwin Carr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Exactly.” Stuart paused in the act of pocketing
off the red. “And if I wanted to be a sandwich-man,
you, or one of you, would get me an introduction to the
very person who owned the identical pitch I had set my
heart on perambulating.” Changing his tactics, he
pocketed the red, viciously.</p>

<p>“Well, but&mdash;&mdash;” Uncle Baldwin liked to be literal,
“what’s that got to do with it? You don’t want to be
a sandwich-man, do you?” apprehensively.</p>

<p>“As much as anything else. Why not? It’s fatal
to specialize.”</p>

<p>Derwent Heron laid his cue in the rack. “What’s
amiss, my boy? Let us probe to the root of the matter,
since we happen to be assembled in full force. Babs,
my dear,” to his flapper daughter, marking for the
players, “run away to your Aunt Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly Barbara obeyed, flinging Stuart a look
of worship as she passed: “Lord, I am here an thou
wantest me!” Youngest of a quartette, her sisters
had carefully bred her in the Heron traditions.</p>

<p>He caught at her long russet plait: “Between ourselves,
Babs,” in a whisper; “how much unearned
increment have you been placing to my account?”</p>

<p>She flushed crimson: “Oh, Stuart, it isn’t cheating,
is it? when it’s not for oneself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll consider the plea. How much?”</p>

<p>“Only ... seven.”</p>

<p>He laughed and released her. Then, strolling to the
board, slid back his disc the requisite number. “Even
in this,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Out with it, Stuart,” from Uncle Arthur, erect on
the hearthrug.</p>

<p>Arthur Heron, junior to the late Graham Heron,
remained something of an enigma to the world at large,
inasmuch as he very rarely spoke, but preferred to
stand with his back to fireplaces; his head a little on
one side, after the fashion of a benign canary; a huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cigar cocked from the left-hand corner of his mouth.
When he occasionally did give vent to speech, his voice
crackled thinly, like charred paper raked from the
grate, so that strangers unfairly suspected him of
laughing at them. In appearance he resembled a small-sized
orange-pip that had lain too long in the sun, and
burnt red instead of yellow.</p>

<p>Derwent Heron, eldest of three brothers, was best
summed up by the adjective “elaborate.” Perhaps to
that, one might add “punctilious.” His speech was
elaborate, and so was his neck-gear; and he was
punctilious in his appointments, and in his manners,
and the discharge of obligations. His tastes were
certainly elaborate, particularly in entrées. Born
punctiliously, he would probably die elaborately. He
was a fine-looking old gentleman, upright, white-haired,
kind-eyed; distinctive by the small pointed imperial
he elected to wear.</p>

<p>Remained Uncle Baldwin, who actually and in point
of birth was not a Heron at all, and therefore far more
Heron than the Herons ever aspired to be. He had,
indeed, been continually obliged to remind them of
their Herondom and all it entailed, since nine years
before, he had entered the family by his marriage with
Eunice, only sister of Derwent, Graham and Arthur,
and very much their junior.</p>

<p>Eunice had died eleven months after; thus forming
so slight a link between her husband and the Herons,
that the latter family were left vaguely wondering how
they had come to be nourishing in their bosom this
well-bred personage with instincts as sleek and groomed
as his own head; in short, how he had happened!</p>

<p>Baldwin dwelt at Sonning; hibernated from September
to May; and during the summer months found his
vocation in following up river regattas in the umpire’s
boat; whence, with the aid of field-glasses, he adjudicated
in a fashion sufficiently impartial to fill Pallas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
herself with envy. He felt occasional qualms of uneasiness
respecting his young nephew’s ability to keep
intact the prestige of the name. Deep down in the
heart of Baldwin may have lain buried a conviction
that safer on his head than on Stuart’s would have been
poised the Heron crown; deeper still, perhaps, the unacknowledged
and pardonable longing once and for all
to kick the cub and put him in his proper place. But
all of this, Baldwin was well aware, must be loyally
suppressed.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Stuart,” he remarked, wounded at
the reception of his intercession with Sir Michael
Forrest, “that you have some ambition of which you
haven’t told us. If you were to own up, we would
naturally give you all the assistance in our power.”</p>

<p>“I know you would,” Stuart interrupted, frowning
heavily in the endeavour to express his meaning.
“And that’s just it. You’ve got too much assistance
in your power. I want to achieve&mdash;and you bring me
the achievement upon a golden salver. Whatever I
mention, it’s the same thing; influence, money, friends&mdash;and
I’m lifted over all the rough places and deposited
on the very summit of desire. What’s left to me after
that? Khalif, what’s left?”</p>

<p>Derwent Heron made no reply to this direct appeal.
He was looking over the double-sliding doors, at an
arresting portrait of his brother Graham, to whom he
owed everything; and who, strangely enough, had
been wont to hold forth in just such an incomprehensible
fashion. Was it not his, Derwent’s, business to do all
he could for the advancement and prosperity of Graham’s
son? unheeding any freaks and phases which the lad
might have brought along from Oxford. He wished
Arthur would speak. But then, Arthur never spoke.
That came from being a bachelor, Derwent reflected
unreasonably.</p>

<p>“Well,” suggested Baldwin, filling up the pause, “if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you’re really keen on adventure, hardship, the philosophic-tramp
business which is now the fashionable
cult, there’s no harm that I can see if you roughed it
for a year or two.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“Dressed in a suit of rags from Clarkson’s, along
Broad Highways carefully laid with red carpet?”
Stuart grinned. For a moment the leprechaun spirit
bade him give up the attempt to lay bare the twists and
turns of his mental asceticism; and instead, draw
exquisite enjoyment from Baldwin’s conception of a
Walt Whitman-esque existence. Then the metaphysician
rejected this outlet as cheap and easy; argued
that there must be means whereby three grown men of
moderate intellect could be convinced of anything, if
sufficient trouble be taken. The metaphysician was
always inclined to be very severe with the leprechaun;
but in this case the leprechaun had the last word,
whispering that it would be a glorious stunt if Khalif,
Vizier and One-eyed Calendar, could indeed be forced
to understanding by dint of sheer brilliant reasoning.
And since Stuart was above all things a Stuntorian, he
forthwith tackled the task.</p>

<p>“Read Kipling, any of you?”</p>

<p>They had all read Kipling. That is to say, Uncle
Arthur had chuckled in secret over “Stalky and Co.”;
Uncle Derwent had seen and appreciated Forbes
Robertson in the “Light that Failed,” and Uncle
Baldwin remembered, at the time of the Boer war,
giving a guinea to a pretty girl who had declaimed the
“Absent-minded Beggar.”</p>

<p>“D’you know ‘Diego Valdez’? It’s in the ‘Five
Nations.’”</p>

<p>“No,” from Derwent and Arthur. Baldwin, idly
chalking cues for want of better employment, said that
he might recognize it if he heard it.</p>

<p>Without preamble or apology, Stuart abruptly flung
at them the bitter complaint of the Spanish Admiral:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The God of fair beginnings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath prospered here my hand ...”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;Fair beginnings, indeed, for the son of the house
of Heron. The oak-panelled walls, the expensive full-sized
billiard-table, the scent of good cigars, the attentive
faces of his three listeners, all seemed to shout this
fact aloud.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To me my king’s much honour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me my people’s love&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The folding-doors slid open, admitting Mrs. Heron and
Babs. Baldwin raised a quick hand of warning:</p>

<p>“Hush. Don’t make a noise. Stuart’s reciting.”</p>

<p>“Damn it, Baldwin!” roared his nephew; “do you
take this for a board school prize-giving?”</p>

<p>Softly Mrs. Heron withdrew, gliding the doors behind
her, with infinite precautions not to jar them in the
contact.</p>

<p>Stuart went on; bent slightly forward from his
careless seat on the edge of the billiard-table; hands
clasped between his knees; the green-shaded quadrangle
of strong lights just above, biting out his features
with uncompromising clarity. His tones were low and
tight with the infinity of pain that underlay the next
verses: Valdez recalling his old adventure days, when
unknown, unfettered, he sailed in happy comradeship
on the South Seas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I dreamt to wait my pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchanged my Spring would bide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, to wait my pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I put my Spring aside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till first in face of fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last in mazed disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I made Diego Valdez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Admiral of Spain.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And a faint mockery twitched the young man’s lips,
as if drawing some secret analogy with the curse of good
fortune following the Spaniard’s every movement.</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Baldwin flicked a fine powder of chalk from his coat-sleeve,
and fixed Stuart with the super-concentrated
glare of one whose attention has wandered. It was
difficult to tell what was the effect of the poem on the
other two men, standing with faces in deepest shadow,
well above the zone of illumination.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They wrought a deeper treason,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led seas that served my needs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sold Diego Valdez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bondage of great deeds.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By a curious power he possessed of projection into the
future, Stuart was able to glimpse himself, victim of a
self-made great career, striving passionately to escape
its easeful heaviness; regain the careless freedom, the
stimulating longings of non-achievement. And he saw,
too, with unerring clarity, how, step by step, he, even
he, another Diego Valdez, might be spurred by inspiring
eloquence, noble example, to such inevitable bondage.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“His will can loose ten thousand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek their loves again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not Diego Valdez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High Admiral of Spain!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Baldwin thought, relieved, that the ensuing pause
marked the signal for opinions to be delivered:</p>

<p>“I must say, I don’t see that the fellow, Diego
What’s-his-name, had much to grumble at.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked towards Derwent, who said, rather
elaborately:</p>

<p>“It seems to me, my dear boy, that I detect an
inconsistency, if I may be permitted to make the remark.
With one breath you assure us that you desire to fight
your battles without assistance to detract from the joy
of victory; while in the verses you so&mdash;er&mdash;ah, yes, so
effectively repeated, I take it that you were voicing a
distaste for the responsibilities of high office consequent
on victory?”</p>

<p>“It does sound as if there were a flaw,” Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
admitted, overjoyed at having evoked a point sufficiently
strong to put him on the defensive: “You might
reconcile it this way, Khalif: I want to do; I don’t
want to become.”</p>

<p>Derwent enquired: “Then what are your plans?
It strikes me as somewhat preposterous that you should
be let work out your destiny from the very bottom of the
ladder, like so many millions who have no alternative.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do, either.” Stuart sprang from the
table; and hands plunged deep in his pockets, head
bent, paced moodily the length of the room. “Without
the actual necessity, that would simply label me as a
freak: the eccentric young millionaire who elects to
work with the masses. However far I wrenched myself
from your powerful wealth and influence, the mere fact
of it would still prevent my struggles from being genuine.
They’d be theatrical, neither more nor less. I’m
damnably placed, Khalif,&mdash;and I want to be a Commissioner
of Oaths!”</p>

<p>This last for Baldwin’s benefit, remarking with concern
that his youngest uncle’s immaculately trousered leg
had remained for a full twenty minutes unpulled.</p>

<p>“A&mdash;what?” Baldwin responded instantly. “Really,
Stuart!”</p>

<p>“I’ve never been told the exact duties of a Commissioner
of Oaths, but the title is alluring in its possibilities,
in the red robust rakish twang of it. Think of
being forever surrounded by an atmosphere of oaths;
thundering oaths, villainous oaths, subtle sanguinary
oaths,” Stuart raised eyes of sky-exalted innocence to
meet Baldwin’s uneasy glare. “Hellish oaths,” he
finished, gently as a child.</p>

<p>“Really, Stuart&mdash;&mdash;” Mr. Carr had much to do to
remember his allegiance. And Derwent Heron, noting
signs of disturbance, hastily broke in with the subject
of his meditations, before it was as ripe as he could
have wished it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you will permit me,” without which preamble he
rarely opened speech, “I have a suggestion to offer;
one which I never before submitted to you, my boy, as
I assumed you were set on gaining laurels in some
profession. Your many triumphs at Oxford accounting
for this mistake on my part. Since it is not to be, how
do you view the idea of a partnership in the business?”
Impressive pause. And then the old man resumed in
faintly ironic voice: “It would give you plenty to do,
nothing to become,&mdash;unless it be Lord Mayor of London.
And that evil can be circumvented with a little discretion
and a sufficient stinginess on charity lists.”</p>

<p>A flicker of surprised amusement in Stuart’s eyes.
“A diamond merchant,” he murmured, ... “why not?
Khalif, Vizier and One-eyed Calendar&mdash;and now behold
Camaralzaman! A bit fantastic, that’s all there is
against it.”</p>

<p>Derwent heard. “If I may venture to prognosticate,
you won’t find much that is fantastic about the offices
in Holborn. However, you needn’t decide all at once;
think the matter over. I need hardly say,” with a
glance that gathered in his partners, “that your father’s
son will be more than welcome; though I, for one, am
disappointed, yes, certainly disappointed, that you
have renounced burdens of a more glorious nature.”</p>

<p>“After all,” quoth Baldwin, “if we all shirked
responsibility in that fashion, where would the world
be?”</p>

<p>To which Arthur Heron, speaking for the first time:
“To every Admiral his Spain. Baldwin’s thinking of
the regatta season.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Arthur,” Stuart cried exuberantly, “your
scalp at least is mine, to nail at my belt!” with which
expression of gratitude to the sole convert of his evening’s
eloquence, he crashed asunder the doors, and made an
effective exit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>



<p class="tbpara">Baldwin was thinking of this scene, in the silence
following his vain effort to turn Stuart from a discipleship
of Nietzsche. From recognition of the fact that,
in spite of philosophy, his nephew had not, after all,
made such a bad diamond merchant, he suddenly
remembered the object of his visit that evening:</p>

<p>“Look here, Stuart, what do you think of this
Antoine Gobert business?”</p>

<p>“I think Antoine Gobert is a clever fraud.”</p>

<p>“Sir Fergus Macpherson seems inclined to believe
there may be something in it.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;that this fellow can actually manufacture
diamonds indistinguishable from the real stone?”</p>

<p>“He thinks there may be something in it.”</p>

<p>“A Scotchman has no right to believe in miracles,”
said Stuart carelessly; but a hard line had crept
between his eyes; he had been buying stock heavily of
late; and if this upstart foreigner should prove after all
to be genuine in his <span class="lock">avowals&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Derwent spoke to Grey, and to Rupert Rosenstein.
There seems to be an idea of paying Gobert a lump
sum to keep him quiet, and then finance his experiments.”</p>

<p>“Experiments! I tell you, Baldwin, the man’s a
swindler.”</p>

<p>“Swindler or not, there’ll be a big drop in the market
if rumours get about.”</p>

<p>“We can hold on.”</p>

<p>Baldwin Carr looked doubtful, as he rose to go:</p>

<p>“I’m dining with Derwent, and I’ll tell him what
you say, but....”</p>

<p>Stuart accompanied him downstairs. The dinner-gong
was drowning the house in sound, and the postman
had just thundered at the door. The butler stepped
forward with a letter on a salver. When Baldwin had
gone, Stuart slit the envelope, and drew forth a dance
invitation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Madame Marcel des Essarts’&mdash;Mother, who’s
Madame Marcel des Essarts?” as Mrs. Heron, on the
arm of her brother-in-law, Arthur Heron, came out of
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you remember, Stuart? She used to
visit me quite often when you were a schoolboy; a
white-haired aristocratic old lady. And once or twice
she brought her little granddaughter; such a pretty
child, and so beautifully dressed, like a French doll,
black hair and red lips and a waxen <span class="lock">face&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“And she wasn’t allowed to play with the tortoise
for fear it should get ferocious and spring at her! Yes,
I remember. She’s evidently sufficiently grown-up for
the ball-room now.”</p>

<p>“Merle des Essarts must be about twenty,” remarked
Mrs. Heron, helping herself to olives; “she has been
abroad a great deal, I believe. If she is half as lovely
as she promised to be, she ought to make a brilliant
match.”</p>

<p>Stuart smiled.</p>

<p>“What do you think of our wizard in diamonds,
Arthur?”</p>

<h3 class="break">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smaller">A CHOICE OF HEROES</span></h3>


<p>The same evening, two girls were huddled in a
doorway of His Majesty’s Theatre. They had
drifted with the crowd down the stone steps
leading from the Upper Circle, their brains struggling
to return to reality from the world-that-is-not. Then a
voice pierced bewilderment with the exclamation:
“Why, it’s raining!” and they emerged on to an
unfamiliar back street, pavements dark mirrors of glistening
wet, something sinister about the hovering gnome-like
figures who sprang alive at their elbows, offering in
hoarse voices to fetch a vehicle. And then umbrellas
began to slide up before their owners had even quitted
the shelter of the outjutting porch; umbrellas with
nasty vindictive spikes. Other people rolled away in
landaulettes and taxi-cabs. It was essentially one of
those occasions which cry out for the luxury of male
protection; for the authoritative voice to say: “stay
where you are for the moment, while I look for the
car.” Then the beckoning summons, the dash to the
kerbstone, an address given, a door slammed, the swift
easy glide up the street: “Now we’re all right,”
remarks the protective male, as he adjusts rug and
window; “beastly night....”</p>

<p>Which is why Peter remarked suddenly, as they
waited for one of the shadow-shapes to be faithful to the
trust reposed in him: “We shall have to admit a man,
Merle, because of the taxis. It’s all right to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
shivering outcast when you get home and think about
it. It’s the present part of the business I object to.
What on earth possessed your grandmother to want the
use of her own carriage to-night?”</p>

<p>“It’s the birthday of an Ambassador,” Merle explained
apologetically; “and she so hates going in
four-wheelers.”</p>

<p>The crowd was thinning. Presently they would be the
only two remaining in the doorway.</p>

<p>“It will be awful to be quite the last of all,” the elder
girl went on apprehensively. “They won’t let us sleep
in the theatre, I’m sure; not after the opera-glasses
have been put away. And the backs of theatres aren’t
in London at all; they’re in a horrible phantom neighbourhood
of their own.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“’Ere y’are, lidies!” Their wheeled deliverance
was at hand.</p>

<p>Peter was spending the night with Merle. She always
appreciated the moment, when, softly closing behind
them the door of the house in Lancaster Gate, she
attended to the bolts and locks, while Merle pierced the
rich blackness with the rays of a small electric lantern,
which was to guide them burglariously up the thickly
carpeted stairs. It was good, remembering their shivering
moments in No-Man’s-Land, now to sprawl in
luxury across the brocaded bed-cover, and watch Merle
submit to the ministrations of the elderly French bonne,
who maided Mademoiselle, and also had a great deal to
say as to what was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i> for the latter’s general
deportment.</p>

<p>“Bonsoir, Nicole. Et merci bien.”</p>

<p>“’Soir, Mesdemoiselles. And do not stay too long
chattering; it is not good for the complexion.” Nicole
retired.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” ejaculated Peter; “that I
should live to own a friend who owns a maid. A maid
<em>and</em> a dressing-gown. Can’t you do something about it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
You know, it’s quite easy to pull off your own stockings,
once you’ve learnt how.”</p>

<p>“Have you brought a comb this time?” Merle
enquired with dangerous politeness.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t. ’Cos why? ’Cos mine has only
seven teeth left in its head, and I daren’t expose its
nakedness to the eye of Nicole, since she <em>will</em> lay out the
contents of my suit-case on the bed, as they do for the
Lady Alice in novelette society house-parties.”</p>

<p>She brushed fiercely at her tangle of curling fair
hair, that was not long enough for the need of hairpins,
nor short enough to lie smooth to her head.</p>

<p>“About the comb,” she continued; “I always say:
‘don’t tell me they’ve forgotten to put it in again!
That comes of letting Amy pack for me’&mdash;or Bertha
or Marion or Pussy, or any other imaginary small sister
I haven’t got. It quite deceives Nicole; she sympathises,
lends me your second-best, and I daresay
wonders at the multiplicity of my mother’s offspring.”</p>

<p>Merle laughed, and turning out the electric lights
cunningly fitted into the three-tiered gilt candelabra,
switched on instead the tiny red lamp which stood
beside her Second Empire bedstead.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà!</i> The appropriate lighting for the traditional
girlish-chatter-while-they-brush-their-hair. Are you
serious in proposing to admit a man to our duet?”</p>

<p>“Quite, if we can find one to suit. I want to try a
trio; it might be interesting.”</p>

<p>“It might be dangerous,” Merle supplemented. She
sat on the edge of the bed, hands clasped about her
knees, the tapestried canopy casting a deep shadow on
her delicately-cut features, flawless as a profile on a
cameo, colourless as ivory. Something of the French
château yet lurked in her quaintly courteous manners;
something of the French convent in the soft voice, in
the heavy eyelids swift to drop as an overweary flower.
The des Essarts were of pure Gallic stock, though their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
devotion to the Royalist cause had half a century
before caused them to seek a permanent dwelling in
England. But Peter declared that Merle still carried
about with her a permanent aura of white lilies in a
cloister garden; that she should by rights always be
clad in an Empire satin frock, high under the arms;
and that if she followed her natural instincts, she would
never enter or quit a room without a deep reverence.</p>

<p>She was certainly “of a loveliness,” as Nicole was
wont to declare, morning and evening, like a Benediction.</p>

<p>“It might be dangerous,” Merle repeated thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You mean, if one of us fell in love with him?”</p>

<p>“Or both.”</p>

<p>“‘The Man Who Came Between Them,’ or ‘The
Eternal Triangle,’ 419th time of representation!”
Peter flung round to face her companion, hands
dramatically clutching at the toilet-table behind her.</p>

<p>“So, after all we’ve been to each other,” she declaimed,
a long pause between each spitten word, “to
let a man rupture our friendship!”</p>

<p>Merle took her cue instantly. She was accustomed
to playing her part in whatever impromptu scene their
conversation might evoke.</p>

<p>“We were fools,” bitter mockery curling her pretty
lips; “if we hadn’t known beforehand&mdash;but we knew&mdash;we
courted the danger. And it has worked itself out
in the old old way.”</p>

<p>Peter crossed to the window, her back to the room,
one hand holding back the velvet hangings, as she
brooded out into the black dripping night.</p>

<p>“A man and two girls. What else could we expect?
We’re only human beings, tho’ we did occasionally rise
to immortality on the wings of swank.”</p>

<p>With an effort Merle retained her gravity: “Can’t
we throw him out even now?” she pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But without turning, the other shook her head.
“There would be a difference. Something smashed. It
never looks the same after mending. And besides ...
we’d miss the excitement.... Ner-no, Merle! once one
admits the question of <span class="lock">sex&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“It’s ... rather a pity, though. Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;”
Merle broke off. In her voice lingered
wistful regrets for the one-time careless happiness they
themselves had set out to destroy. “I can’t make
out,” she questioned, groping hopelessly, “when it all
started, where, why. How we could have allowed it to
go so far. If we hadn’t both clung to the pretence that
nothing was wrong, we might have stopped it.”</p>

<p>And the harsh reply, so unlike Peter’s usual buoyant
tones:</p>

<p>“Stopped his love of you, or my love for him,&mdash;which?”</p>

<p>Merle permitted herself an aside: “Oh, it’s to be
that way, is it?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” and Peter also slipped for a moment
out of the circle of limelight. “You, being the Beautiful
One, are sure to come in an easy first. And I’d rather
play the Unwanted Woman; it affords more scope for
my histrionic abilities,” in proof of which, she continued
her rôle in such a natural manner that Merle was not
sure or not if the tragedy had been indeed resumed.</p>

<p>“I’m going. There’s no sense in dragging this on
indefinitely. I shall want to come back and talk about
it when I get to the foot of the stairs. It’ll be funny ...”
a half-laugh here that might have been a sob, “funny
to think of never coming back. We’ve rehearsed this
sort of good-bye so often in jest&mdash;haven’t we?”</p>

<p>At which Merle flung herself back among the pillows,
both hands pressed tightly to her forehead.</p>

<p>“Pax, Peter! pax! I give it up. You’ve twisted
up a rehearsal inside a rehearsal, and I don’t know any
more if I’m real. Peter, I give it up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter laughed; and returning from her bowed
passage to the door, leapt on to the foot of the bed,
drawing up both her legs beneath her, Turkish fashion.</p>

<p>“Now we can’t really quarrel, man or no man. This
scene will act as a lightning-conductor, catch it on its
way and render it harmless. Besides, anyhow we could
never quarrel, because of your grandmother, not to
mention my aunt; you know we would hear nothing
but: ‘You never ask that charming Peter Kyndersley
to tea, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chérie</i>, and you were once so fond of her’; and
‘There was a time when Merle des Essarts couldn’t be
here enough’ (sniff), ‘I suppose you’ve had a tiff with
her!’ A simply unbearable situation; in sheer self-defence
we should have to combine forces again.”</p>

<p>Peter looked about her for a cigarette; then,
remembering where she was, abandoned the search, and
gave her whole attention to the subject in hand:</p>

<p>“To return to the <span class="lock">man&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Is he to bring any qualifications besides a magnetic
attraction for taxis?”</p>

<p>“Waiters,” promptly. “Knowledge of the exact
shade of tone in which to address a waiter; neither
jocose, nor frigid, nor yet deprecating.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose you station yourself near the buffet
at our dance; and listen carefully to the demands for
claret-cup.”</p>

<p>“Your dance!” snatching at the words; “Merle,
you’ve hit on the exact setting for the introduction of
our Extra Element of Excitement. When is it?”</p>

<p>“Next month. The invitations went out this morning.”</p>

<p>“And who’s coming? Men, I mean.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and twenty-two in all,” Merle murmured;
“do you want their names? I’m sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be sleepy, then, while I’m playing at the
Fates, and Destiny, and the Will of Heaven, all in one.”
She reached out to the escritoire, and grabbed pencil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and paper. “I’m going to make a catalogue; fire
away! You know these hundred and odd males; I
don’t. Fling me the most likely ones, and I’ll run them
through an informal examination. Such as: ‘will you
play Pirates nicely?’ ‘do you mind damp socks?’
‘can you talk nonsense earnestly, and of earnest
matters nonsensically?’ Above all, ‘do you feel equal
to the manipulation of a trio?’”</p>

<p>“I shall enjoy watching from afar the face of your
partner, while you treat him to all that. Put down
Justin Carruthers, for a start.”</p>

<p>Peter scribbled the name: “Special distinguishing
marks?”</p>

<p>“Black waistcoat where other people elect to wear
white, and a tendency to serious intentions. Logan
Thane owns a country-seat with grapes and antlers,
and will, if properly trained, stand up by a mantelpiece
and slash with his riding-whip. Bertie Milligan, youthful
and intense, now in the clutches of a designing female;
the Oxford voice&mdash;and can use it to imitate ducklings.
Grey Rubinstein, fat, and the son of a judge&mdash;but with
possibilities of humour. Armand Drelincourt has just
bought another motor-car. Always. And will tell you
about his fatal temperament. Roy Clarke, a due sense
of his own importance, and could be brought to develop
a sense of ours; one-steps like seven devils. Mark
St. Quentin&mdash;&mdash;” Merle broke off the catalogue with a
laugh; “you know Mark; he was the means of bringing
us together; I don’t think we’ll place another responsibility
upon his soul. José di Gasparis vibrates like a
cinema when he dances; and the blacking of his shoes
will come off on your satin ones. Won’t that do? I
can’t think of any more.”</p>

<p>Peter had been scribbling furiously. She glanced
with critical eye down the list.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring this with me on the 18th, though I can’t
say the material is promising. I like Logan Thane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
best.” She mused awhile over the names. “Yes, Merle,
I think it will be Logan Thane.”</p>

<p>But Merle’s straight black lashes already shadowed
her cheeks. She was, if anything, lovelier asleep than
awake. Peter glanced at her with a certain whimsical
tenderness&mdash;then crept in beside her, and switched off
the crimson light.</p>

<p>“We do need the taxi-man,” was her last coherent
thought; “she more than I. She’s more feminine.
Or at least, she’s somehow allowed to show more
feminine.”</p>



<p class="tbpara">Pepita Kyndersley lived with an aunt at Thatch
Lane, some half an hour’s distance by rail from London.
Her mother was dead. Her father, responsible for her
name, a tenor ballad-singer; sometimes in evening-dress,
at a private entertainment; oftener in a red
hunting-coat with gilt buttons, at a pier concert. At
all times, a disreputable but attractive personage,
never to be mentioned by Peter’s aunt; treated by
Peter herself, when she chanced to meet him twice or
thrice in the year, with good-humoured and tolerant
amusement, as from one man to another. Nor would
she have found objection in attaching herself permanently
to the “Idol of all the Capitals of Europe,”
as the leaflets were wont to declare him after a tour of
the watering-places between Margate and Beachy
Head; such an erratic existence was not without its
charms; but the Idol shook his head at her suggestion:</p>

<p>“I would not have the bloom brushed from your
girlhood, my Pepita,” tenderly.</p>

<p>Peter laughed: “The ladies who find your voice so
full of tears and your hair so full of wave, would lose
some of their enthusiasm if they saw you forever
accompanied by a grown-up daughter. Is that it?”</p>

<p>Bertram Kyndersley deprecated; met the said
daughter’s eye&mdash;and slowly winked his own; an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>excusable
loss of moral equilibrium, atoned for by the
rich sobriety of his next remark:</p>

<p>“You are a great comfort to me, my little girl. Your
poor mother said you would be a comfort to me,” for
by this manner of speech did he seek reminder of his
surprising parenthood, a factor he was otherwise liable
to forget, but to which he fondly clung for the sake of
its unanswerable link with respectability. Then he
borrowed her quarterly dress allowance, and went with
it a-wooing.</p>

<p>So Peter dwelt with her mother’s elder sister at
Thatch Lane. That is to say, they had bedrooms in
the same house, and took their meals together. But
Miss Esther Worthing’s universe consisted of herself,
wearing a high linen collar and carrying an umbrella;
surrounded by houses containing each a county family&mdash;particular
county a matter of indifference; surrounded
in turn by churches&mdash;orthodox, of course;
English public schools, mostly Eton; the whole encircled
by a high wall, beyond which dwelt foreigners,
Jews, artists, and suchlike. Peter being distinctly suchlike,
knew herself well beyond the wall, and was quite
content to abide there. Occasionally she made concessions
to her aunt by allowing herself to be exploited
in county circles; county in this case consisting of
Thatch Lane. She had exhausted the resources of
Thatch Lane practically at the outset; wrung from the
place and people all they contained of stimulation;
zigzagged like a streak of lightning through the lives of
the young men of the neighbourhood, finished them
off before they were well aware of being started; remaining
still avid for something that could wear out her
marvellous brain and superb body; tear from her that
bright defiant liberty she claimed as her chief right;
someone who could tire her ... tire her? at times
she felt more weariness for lack of battle than defeat
could ever have brought in its train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Particular occupation she had none; but took her
days unlinked, in something of the true vagabond
spirit, each one for what it would bring her. Days that
began with dawn and ended with darkness, and naught
of connection between darkness and dawn. Neither did
she own a knit coterie of friends; but had picked up a
random assortment, and darted in and out of their
separate spheres of life, as the need or the careless
fancy took her. So that there was a certain lack of
rhythmic swing, of cohesion, in her twenty-three years,
till she met Merle des Essarts.</p>

<p>They flashed together at a charity subscription dance
in the Assembly Hall at Thatch Lane. Merle had been
motored thither by some acquaintances, forced into an
extensive purchase of tickets. Peter was on the committee;
and had donned for the evening an appropriate
voice and expression. For she took pride in her powers
of outward adjustment to whatever part she was called
upon to play, while able to regard her motley the while
with amused and appreciative detachment.</p>

<p>They happened with their respective partners at the
same supper-table.</p>

<p>Merle’s partner cut his thumb.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I ought to bind it up.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like blood-poisoning to set in.”</p>

<p>“It’s not worth making a fuss. I hate making a
fuss.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying much about it, but as a matter of
fact, I’m in considerable pain.”</p>

<p>“Look, Miss des Essarts!”</p>

<p>Merle did not want to look, but the thumb of Mark
St. Quentin was thrust upon her.</p>

<p>“It is bad, isn’t it?” courteously.</p>

<p>Presently she was invited to look again; and again
she took an intelligent interest. It was just sufficiently
bad to spoil her entrée.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying much about <span class="lock">it&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me tie it up for you,” quoth Peter suddenly,
noting the other girl’s lack of appetite.</p>

<p>Peter produced a dainty square of lawn and lace.
Peter bent her boyish halo of hair in deep absorption
over the injured member. And both her own partner
and the victim supplied all the obvious patter about the
“healing touch,” and “it was worth while to have
suffered,” and “some people have all the luck,” and
(of course) “will you let me keep the handkerchief?”&mdash;unutterable
meanings in the request.</p>

<p>“‘When pain and anguish wring the brow,’” Merle
murmured to her plate, as a very flushed ministering
angel raised her head from the act of mercy.</p>

<p>Peter tossed her a look of indignation, and afterwards
waylaid her in the corridor:</p>

<p>“See here,” hotly, “I don’t know who you are, but
I made an ass of myself so that you should enjoy your
sweetbreads, and then you rag me about it!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Merle replied, very penitent. “And I
am grateful to you, really. But you didn’t see his
ecstatic expression while you bound up the wound.
Please forgive me&mdash;and let me replace the handkerchief.”</p>

<p>Peter liked this girl with the curious foreign lilt in
her accent, and the demure sense of humour. And when
a few days later a half-dozen of finely embroidered handkerchiefs
arrived, together with a formal invitation to
take tea with the sender, she went with a foreknowledge
of having at last discovered someone who could speak
her peculiarly twisted language.</p>

<p>She found a French bonbon in an exquisite bonbonnière;
she found a jewel in its pink-lined casket; she
found a dainty little lady, guarded and cherished as is
only a “jeune fille” of French extraction; exquisitely
dressed; very much in the picture, whether in the
Louis-Seize drawing-room, or the Empire boudoir, or on
the front seat of her grandmother’s roomy and old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
barouche. And buried deep beneath these
ornamentations, she found more of herself than she
ever thought to encounter in a fellow-being. So much
of herself, that it was almost a shock to vanity.</p>

<p>They did not become Best Friends in the sense of
choosing each other’s hats, and walking with interlaced
arms. They walked instead with interlaced lives. And
from a series of vivid and incongruous patches, Peter
now saw it possible to weave the pattern of her existence
and Merle’s, so that the minutes were linked to the hours,
and the seasons pursued one another the round of the
calendar, and every haphazard personage was given a
meaning, and every group of persons. And they
planned undertakings and carried them through always;
and robbed fiction of adventure, to place that wild-haired
lass in the setting of things-that-happen. Journeys
did they plot, preceded by an elaborate structure of
deception for the benefit of Miss Esther Worthing, and
an entirely different édition de luxe to satisfy Madame
des Essarts; thus necessitating great play for the
exercise of their ingenuity. If one mood led them to
revel in utterly childish delights, such as raising the
golden-syrup spoon high above the plate, so as to let
the shining liquid drop in coils and patterns upon the
bread, a swift change of circumstances showed the twain
in ultra-luxurious furs and ultra-spotless white kid
gloves, setting forth solemnly, and with the moral
support of a card-case, to “pay calls.” They arranged
imaginary “parties,” one for the other; of which
Merle’s favourite showed stately Madame des Essarts
playing a prominent part with Bertram Kyndersley of
the Melting Eye; though Peter inclined more to a
fanciful alliance she had promoted between the Sphinx
and the Albert Memorial&mdash;with dire results to the white
flower of a blameless statue’s life.</p>

<p>Merle caught Peter’s infectious trick of light brilliant
patter-talk, so that the likeness between the twain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
marvellous to those who could not pierce beneath
exterior resemblances. It was Peter who invariably
started the vein of nonsense, Merle who capped it at the
finish. Merle did not breathe the atmosphere as a
matter of course; she had too long been nourished in
hot-house solemnity, and her witticisms tumbled out
with a surprised little lift in the voice, as if in astonishment
at their escape from bondage. Nor could she ever
learn sublime disregard of the feelings and conveniences
of others, but would linger to propitiate the breathless
fragments scattered by the swift onrush of Peter’s
imperial passage; continued, in spite of her friend’s
laughing remonstrances, to pay reverential homage to
white hairs, and display a certain polite hauteur where
persons of inferior station were in question. One jested,
yes,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais pas avec les autres</i>! “You deserve to die on
the guillotine,” quoth Peter.</p>

<p>But she gave in, notwithstanding her leadership,
before the chill of Merle’s little reserves. For&mdash;and here
lay the sting of the matter&mdash;instinct would not lead her
exactly to where these reserves lay hidden; she would
stumble on them unawares, without the remotest
notion for what reason just that particular mention or
sally or point of view, should call forth in the other a
mood resembling cold water, finely sprayed. Merle
herself, thus argued Peter, could on occasions be as
daringly demurely blasphemous, so why....</p>

<p>But Peter knew well enough that the careless years
she had spent knocking about with her parents and their
shoddy coarse-grained good-natured associates, had
done their destroying work. It is always absurd to
suppose, in the popular fashion, that whatever a girl’s
surroundings, her outlook can remain pure and flower-like
and uncontaminated. Certain words had to be
checked on her tongue; the itch for a cigarette was
ever in her fingers; she was familiar with what she
termed the “man-look,” and recognized too soon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
dawning of intentions that needed to be checked. Other
traces there were: a cool disregard as to the state of
undress in which circumstances might chance to discover
her straight young limbs; meanings of the under-world
that attached themselves to perfectly innocent
phrases. Not a very profound under-world; just below
the glazed surface. And experiences had been hers,
squalid enough to give pleasure in the recollection, when
balancing a fragile teacup at some opulent afternoon
reception.</p>

<p>These after-effects could hardly be considered serious;
merely annoying to have perceptions so far blunted as to
give no warning on the rare occasions when Merle’s
greater fineness was in danger. “I would not have the
bloom brushed from your girlhood, my Pepita!”&mdash;it
amounted to that, after all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smaller">PLAYING AT GOD</span></h3>


<p>“I think it is going to be Logan Thane,” Peter
decided, as she paused for a moment in the
pleasing process of dressing for the dance, to
stand bare-limbed before the fire, and feel its warmth
run and leap and shiver over her skin; one of those
luxuries to which memories of chill apartments and
scrambled toilets now gave a zest and flavour. Peter
liked equally the action of slowly drawing a cigarette
from its silver case; the use of a bathroom, gleaming
white tiles and silver taps and mist-wreaths dimming
the mirror on the wall. Things which Merle took as a
matter of course. Merle found her keenest enjoyment
in escape for a whole day to Thatch Lane, to trespass
over barbed-wire fencing in dank and thorny woods;
discarding, for an old skirt and jersey of Peter’s, the
elaborately suitable-for-the-country raiment provided
by Madame des Essarts. Madame’s mental vision of
these expeditions showed her granddaughter reclining
upon a cushioned chair, in a very clean field, the while
Miss Worthing’s footman (non-existent) asked if she
took sugar and milk, and Peter added solicitously:
“You must put up with our picnic teas, Merle, dearest.
Will you have some Devonshire cream on your home-baked
bread?”</p>

<p>Ever since their conversation on the second-empire
bedspread, a fortnight before, the two girls were almost
hypnotically persuaded that the forthcoming ball was
to furnish, as far as their scheme of things was concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
some startling issue. During their intercourse of two
and a half years, the male element in its more serious
form had been conspicuously and even unnaturally
lacking. Peter was aware that this state of things
could not possibly continue, in the case of two so
magnetically alive. She had sought to forestall the
Inevitable, by herself weaving in the thread. To-night
she would choose its colour. To-night!... it was fun,
playing at God.</p>

<p>Logan Thane fixed himself firmer and ever firmer in
her imagination, while she put on her gold stockings
and shoes, her bronze evening-dress, with its border of
rich fur, and swathed gold sash. His name held possibilities;
and she was not averse to the background of
antlers and hothouse grapes, catalogued by Merle. She
added to these, roses, and a sweet white-haired mother;
picturing agreeably how the latter would describe Merle
and herself as “quite at home in Thane Manor; running
in and out all day; dear girls, both of them!”&mdash;Logan
at this juncture tossed them an expressive smile from
where he stood, as per arrangement, smiting his boot
with a riding-whip.</p>

<p>And if he should fall in love with one or the other of
them....</p>

<p>“It would be rough luck on Merle,” mused Peter,
drawing on her long white kid gloves.</p>

<p>Certainly Peter was divinely human!</p>



<p class="tbpara">Someone knocking at the door:</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” cries Jinny, aged fourteen;
“the Lesters are here, and don’t I just wish I was going
too!”</p>

<p>Peter is staying the week-end with some twice-removed
cousins in a Turnham Green boarding-house;
a convenience of which she frequently availed herself,
when evening pleasure-seeking made it impossible for
her to catch the last train from Euston to Thatch Lane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The Lester boys and their sister, friends of Merle, had
offered to fetch her in their car and bring her home
again.</p>

<p>“And so if we don’t enjoy ourselves,” proposes Rose-Marie,
a nervous débutante, “we can keep to our own
party....” The car moves slowly forward in a long
queue.</p>

<p>Peter is not enthusiastic. Both the Lester boys are
under twenty, and have pimples on their chins. She
wishes&mdash;in the cloakroom now, and in the approved
fashion letting her wrap fall languidly from her shoulders,
to be caught by dexterous and silent attendants&mdash;that
the thought of Merle hostess of this magnificence, did
not remove her so very far from the Merle of their
adventure days.</p>

<p>The staircase again, and conventional figures in black
and white, struggling with their glove-buttons. Which
of them is Logan Thane? “Wait for me,” pleads
Rose-Marie, still busy with her powder-puff. A burst
of music from the ballroom, striking thrilling response
from the tuned-up senses. Events moving with the
swift unreality of a cinema. The ballroom swims
forward and engulfs Peter with its hum of talk, rising
and falling like waves on a flat beach; its light mellowed
by blossoms; blossoms made translucent by light.
Impression of a group just within the doorway; Merle’s
grandmother, from a mere solicitous voice in Lancaster
Gate: “Es-tu fatiguée, chérie?” knuckles that tapped
the door and a rustle that swept the staircase,&mdash;now
materialized into diamonds, and Point d’Alençon, and
dignified, almost royal, reception of the entering guests.
Mademoiselle des Essarts, a little to her left, beauty in
faint old-rose and lilac, silver-threaded; a tiny moon-shaped
black patch below the lip; a bouquet of lilies
of the valley. Mademoiselle des Essarts&mdash;“Elle est
exquise,” whisper the diplomats and the ambassadors
and the consuls, beribboned and bearded, who surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Madame, and lend a contrast of French court circles to
the assembly of bostoning twentieth-century youth.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle des Essarts receives Miss Kyndersley
with grave unsmiling courtesy, and introduces: “Mr.
Milligan.”</p>

<p>Is this the owner of a new motor-car, or a Designing
Female? Desperately Peter tries to collect her whirling
thoughts, while Merle, according to previous arrangement,
detaches herself from other duties, to present one
partner after another; names that sound familiar:
“the son of a judge ... can imitate ducklings ...
black waistcoat where others elect to wear white,”&mdash;easily
distinguishable, this last; “a life-story ...
serious intentions ... seven devils and a shoe-black”
... the descriptions on the list jostle each other, and
form part of the brilliant kaleidoscopic blur which goes
to make Peter’s evening. She is beginning to enjoy
the keen sense of expectancy with which she herself has
infused the air. Light as the flutter of a peaseblossom,
Merle blows across the polished floor: “Peter, have
you a dance left? I want to introduce you&mdash;&mdash;” no,
the pink card is already scribbled over from top to
bottom.</p>

<p>“Never mind; you can cut&mdash;let me see!” coolly
Mademoiselle scans the names, and crosses off a harmless
personage bearing the Oriental title of Otto Mann.
“He’s not important” ... and she presents Mr. Thane,
who looks rather astonished at these unceremonious
proceedings, but laughingly accepts number twenty-three,
the last waltz but one.</p>

<p>“I believe you’ll do!” thinks Peter exultantly. But
nevertheless, she will give other unconscious candidates
their chance. Her peculiar talent for playing up, body
and soul, to whatever part be thrust upon her, can be
exercised to its full in the swift coming and going,
change and interchange of companionship, that is
ballroom custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The first waltz stirs the air. The first skilful probing
of the material with which she has to deal: cue given:
“Don’t you find these affairs leave an empty feeling
behind them?”... so be it, then; the Puritan maid&mdash;for
ten minutes. And you, sir, what may be your
demands? Can’t be bothered with depths, or all that
bally rot? Come then, we will e’en butterfly together....
And the music strikes up for the next one-step;
Papillon bows and departs, and&mdash;who will come in his
stead? Walk up! walk up, gentlemen all! Here are
a variety of goods in one parcel: the Artistic Understanding;
the Tantalizing Sphinx; Up-to-date Woman
of the World, with trick of shoe and eyelash and epigram&mdash;this
for the youth who will not be thought young;
quickly alternating to the Clear-eyed Delightful Child:
her first dance, and it’s all such splendid fun! Almost
can Thirty-nine, cynical, weary, and grizzled at the
temples, be brought to say: “Little girl, you make the
years fall from me....”</p>

<p>Peter wriggles happily. Who can denounce her
conduct as unfair? Who, at a masquerade, music-led,
rose-fragrant, expects to confront aught but fellow-masqueraders?...
Here comes another&mdash;Aha! I
recognize you, my friend; you are he who vibrates like
a jelly in dancing, and&mdash;apprehensively she glances
down at her gold shoes in danger from the kiss of
Othello.</p>

<p>Take from Peter what you please, gentlemen all! not
for your sakes, believe me that. For Peter’s sake; for
the glorification of her talents, and for the fun of it, and
because you may take from Peter what you please, so it
be not Peter. And she is safe enough, dodging mischievously
from one disguise to another, rather wishing&mdash;through
all the breathless shift and stir and glimmer&mdash;to
meet for once her equal in skill and tactics. But it
will come with the twenty-third waltz of the evening,
promised to Antlers-and-Hothouse-Grapes; she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
staged her climax cunningly, to crown the end of
masquerade.</p>

<p>Supper with Mark St. Quentin, who had two years
previously sent her a dozen handkerchiefs, in lieu of the
gory one, tenderly retained; thus making for the
ministering angel a clear profit of seventeen handkerchiefs,
reckoning Merle’s half-dozen. He has spent
this evening in being to Peter the cement which knits
loose bricks together; watching her hungrily when she
slides away in the embrace of another; slipping into
the gap when a partner chances to be late; taking the
first dance and the last dance and the supper-dance,
and any extras she cares to give, and all the numbers
she wishes to cut. Quite pleasant, the consciousness of
Mark St. Quentin to fill with his stolid and persistent
personality the tiniest chink and crevice which the
intoxicating hours might otherwise have left empty.
Nor is it difficult to supply him with the goods he wants:
a solicitous reference to the episode of the thumb, and
Peter is established as fragrant sweet-natured woman,
thank Heaven, still surviving in a century of Suffragettes
and kleptomaniacs&mdash;“And druggists,” adds Mark St.
Quentin; “Morphia, you know.”</p>

<p>After-supper hours, bringing with them the usual
flushed dishevelment, actual and spiritual. Blooms
beginning to droop in the heat; prevailing carelessness
as to the hieroglyphics actually scrawled on the programme;
bold voices, mingling with the bandsmen’s
deeper notes, as they chorus to the popular encore,
imperiously demanded. Lingerings on the stairs, and
where softly-lit seclusion is provided for those who care
to linger. Departure of the suave and elderly diplomats;
Madame des Essarts must perforce wait, royalty unattended,
till romping insatiable youth shall have
drunk its fill. Her reflections on modern dancing, its
antics and exaggerations, are such as to preclude
description. She is pleased to note, however, that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
granddaughter’s burnished dark head is still unruffled,
her complexion unheated. “Elle est vraie des Essarts!”</p>

<p>Number twenty-one. Merle and Peter, skilfully
guided where the throng is thickest, smile at one another
in passing, eager, in the midst of enjoyment, for the
mutual retrospection of the morrow. Comes the interval
between twenty-two and twenty-three. Armand
Drélincourt, for the third time in four hours, discourses
with immense relish upon his fatal temperament. Peter
listens attentively, but springs to her feet, interrupting
the narrative at its most thrilling point, when the far-off
tinkle of a bell reaches her ear: “Hadn’t we better go
down?” Having settled on Logan Thane as a piratical
playmate, she is frankly excited at the prospect of
number twenty-three.</p>

<p>He is not waiting near the door of the ballroom.
Neither is he in the stream descending the stairs. Peter
waits impatiently till he shall choose to end his flirtation
behind some draped <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portière</i>. Already the dancers are
in full swing. Rose-Marie approaches: “Shall we go
home now, Peter? Most people have left; it looks so
bad to be among the last.” And behold St. Quentin
standing faithful as the painted sentinel of Herculaneum:
“May I have the pleasure, Miss Kyndersley?”</p>

<p>“I’m booked already,&mdash;where <em>is</em> Logan Thane?”</p>

<p>“But your partner seems to have deserted you. Silly
fellow; he doesn’t know what he’s missing.”</p>

<p>Peter privately agrees. It takes still three minutes
to convince her that Logan Thane has undoubtedly cut
his dances and gone home early; and then she lets
St. Quentin reap the reward of his tireless vigil: “I
shall be leaving after this one, so we may as well finish
it instead of the next.” She has flushed richly and
her eyes are dark with annoyance. Childishly, she
wants Logan Thane to have a sense of all that might
have been his, had he not succumbed to weariness.</p>

<p>“Peter,” Rose-Marie’s voice, plaintive now; “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
car has been waiting over an hour already, and mother
<span class="lock">said&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“All right.” Peter disengages herself from the
infatuated St. Quentin, murmurs her thanks to her
hostess, looks around in vain for Merle, and suffers
herself to be led by Rose-Marie to the cloak-room.</p>

<p>Downstairs, a few stray couples, clinging still to the
fringes of pleasure, boston stormily to the strains of
“Gipsy Love.” The massed flowers on the walls hang
heavier and heavier yet. Madame has yawned twice,
daintily, behind her Pompadour fan. As the last notes
die away, Merle dashes for the doorway, dragging her
partner in her wake.</p>

<p>“Peter!&mdash;she hasn’t gone yet, has she, grandmaman?”
She succeeds in waylaying Peter, cloaked
and reluctant, on her passage down the main staircase.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t go. I want you to dance the next
with Stuart.” Merle’s tone conveys all she dares put
into it of meaning and entreaty. Peter shakes her head,
indicating Rose-Marie, inclined to be fractious.</p>

<p>“Leave her to me. <em>Do</em> go on, Peter.”</p>

<p>Peter wavers; the ballroom, after good-byes have
been spoken and wraps adjusted, becomes doubly a
place of enchantment, if only because etiquette debars
from re-entering.</p>

<p>She looks at Stuart Heron.</p>

<p>And he, for his part, tries to trace the connection
between a tall girl in a bronze evening-cloak, and a
picture which has forced itself irrelevantly upon his
mental vision: picture of a Cavalier emerging from
some dark doorway; backward-floating plume, and
mantle carelessly flung; swagger and smile expressive
of all that lurked in his quest of love and hazard, and
peradventure of hazardous love....</p>

<p>“Go on, Peter,” urges Merle. “You’ll like him.”</p>

<p>Peter hesitates no longer; tosses aside her cloak;
and permits Stuart to escort her back to the regions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
light whence she had thought to be self-banished. The
band is crashing out in true Bacchanalian frenzy the
last waltz of all, the waltz of their release. Twenty
years before, and it would have been: “After the ball
is over,” with its cloying suggestions of regret and
sentiment; but modern youth requires something at
once more abandoned and more discordant.</p>

<p>Stuart speaks: “She said I was going to like you.”</p>

<p>“And she said I was going to like you.”</p>

<p>Then in earnest duet: “How we’re bound to hate
each other!”</p>

<p>He is a little above medium height; their eyes are
almost on a level. He cannot rid himself of the impression
that whatever he says now, is likely to matter
later on. And the entire contents of his brain have
wandered round the corner, and sitting there, mock his
futility.</p>

<p>“No,” contradicting his own statement. “I don’t
think we shall hate each other; at least, not more than
is necessary to preserve mutual interest.” Why are
they hurrying the time, those fool musicians? How
long can one decently sit out with a girl, after the last
candle is extinguished, and a lackey is holding her
cloak in readiness? Seven minutes, perhaps? He
will have to give her in that seven minutes lightning
indications of all that is in him worth her knowing;
whet her curiosity, and at the same time satisfy his
own. The undertaking is a breathless one.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” Peter queries, having in vain
tried to fit him with some attributes of Merle’s catalogue.
“I can’t place you at all, <span class="lock">and&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“And what?” he leaps in, for she has paused, and
there is no time to pause; two more couples have
ceased to dance, and are busy encircling Madame des
Essarts with an aura of thanksgiving and farewell.
“And what?”</p>

<p>“And Merle introduced you as if you mattered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Merle was quite right. I do matter.”</p>

<p>“Merle?”</p>

<p>“Why not? I’m a relic of her childhood.”</p>

<p>“It makes you sound like Stonehenge.”</p>

<p>“You strive rather after effect, don’t you?” He
slings this at her, himself striving after effect.</p>

<p>“Of course. Would you have me display at once all
the domestic virtues?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any,” tauntingly. “Not one. Other
girls can cook nothing but an omelette. You, I’m sure,
can cook nothing at all. It must be a proud boast. I
hate talking while I dance, don’t you?”</p>

<p>In silence they finish the waltz. Then Stuart sweeps
her through a pair of velvet hangings, down two rooms,
and to a sofa at the far end of a third, before she is well
aware of his intentions. She takes a sidelong survey of
his outward marks: features that vie for room with his
monocle and quickly-changing expression, giving an
effect to his face of overcrowding; a mouth corner-tilted
and impish, such as is sometimes perceived in a
small street-arab, but mostly in a leprechaun, who can
only be met hammering shoes on moor and crag by
moonlight. She notes further that his jaw is lean, with
the forward bent of a runner; and his head, which by
dint of hard brushing and grooming gives at first an
effect of conventional sleekness, is in reality a most
rebellious and intricate affair, no hair growing in
precisely the same direction as its fellow, but each
insisting it will beat out like Bret Harte’s pioneer, “a
way of his own, a way of his own!”</p>

<p>From the distant ballroom, snatches of “God save
the King” drift and die and are re-born, with an effect
of inexpressible melancholy. And, sighing, Stuart
relinquishes desire to show the girl all his sides before
dawn&mdash;philosophical, tender, childish, manly, sporting,
whimsical, or political,&mdash;resigns himself to proving
merely that he is original.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can never get away from your likeness to a
Reynolds’ Angel,” à propos of nothing; “because there
are five of them, so that if the expression should miss
one, it will hit the next; I’m sorry for you, of course,
but there is nothing to be done about it. Do you live
anywhere? Forgive me for these astounding acrobatics,
but I’m so afraid you will be fetched by your nurse Rose-Marie;
I heard you remark she was growing fractious.”</p>

<p>“I live in Thatch Lane with an aunt. My mother is
dead, and my father unmentionable, to save you from
the agonies of a tactless question.”</p>

<p>... The bandsmen are dimly visible, packing away
their mute instruments. A voice from the long-ago is
calling faintly “Peter” ... hastily she covers the
sound: “<em>What</em> are you? A stockbroker?”</p>

<p>“No,” he too has heard, and speaks rather breathlessly;
“do I make love like a stockbroker?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I have, in my own subtle fashion. But I <em>can’t</em>
overleap the first stages in this Post-impressionist
preliminary scamper of ours.”</p>

<p>... “Pet-er! Pe-ter!” clearer now&mdash;and nearer.</p>

<p>“A stockbroker has but seven stages of love-making,
and by these shall ye know him,” laughs Peter.</p>

<p>“And I have a hundred and seven, and seven more
after that, and by none of these shall ye know me.”</p>

<p>“Do you always talk about yourself?”</p>

<p>“No,” desperately; “I can talk about ever so many
things: Cathedrals, and good form, and machinery, and
how to make pins. Oh, and metaphysics. Particularly
metaphysics. I took a double first at Oxford. I’ve no
right to tell you, but I want you to know,” with the
first touch of boyishness that has as yet escaped the
hard polished surface of his manner.</p>

<p>... “I can’t think where she is,” Merle replies
courteously, two rooms off.</p>

<p>... “Pee-ee-eee-ter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“Confound it! How can I be eloquent with that
phantom female forever squawking like the poor cat i’
the adage.”</p>

<p>Peter remarks, caring not a whit for Rose-Marie:
“I’m sure that an adage is a medieval Scotch pantry,
and that the cat was stealing the cream.”</p>

<p>“The ‘Cat and Adage’ wouldn’t be a bad public-house,”
Stuart reflects; “in case I shouldeverwanttobuilda&mdash;damn!”
in an outburst of frenzied and polysyllabic
fury, as a little procession, consisting of Merle,
Rose-Marie, the two brothers of Rose-Marie, and Mark
St. Quentin, advance with triumphant shoutings
towards the truants’ retreat.</p>

<p>His curses are overtopped by St. Quentin’s pæans of
victory:</p>

<p>“I told you I’d seen them come this way. You’ve
given us a rare hunt, Miss Kyndersley.” And the
eldest and most pimply of the Lester twins shakes a
playful finger:</p>

<p>“Bedtime, you know, Miss Peter. No good running
away and hiding.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” Stuart turns abruptly away, not
caring to form part of the returning procession across
three rooms. Nor does he express any audible hopes of
renewing an acquaintance so delightfully begun.</p>



<p class="tbpara">“Well?” Merle threw a world of mischievous
expectancy into the interrogation, when Peter paid her
promised visit at tea-time the following day.</p>

<p>Merle was lying on the couch, her back supported by
many cushions, a silken wrap thrown lightly over her
feet. For Madame des Essarts cherished the notion
that constitutions of delicate birth were necessarily
also of delicate health, to attain which desirable consummation,
she kept a venerable and witty doctor in
daily attendance, and reduced Merle on the slightest
provocation from the vertical to the horizontal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter tossed down her hat, and sank into a curly-legged
arm-chair.</p>

<p>“I wish this weren’t such an impossible room,” she
grumbled; “what with gilt and tapestries and priceless
china and painted ladies on the ceiling, I can
hardly hear myself speak. It’s the sort of room you can’t
take up and wrap round you. What we ought to do,
Merle, is with the aid of a ladder, a big apron, and a
bottle of gum, cover the walls ourselves in brown paper,
like those brave bright Bohemian bachelor girls in
books.”</p>

<p>“Well?” quoth Merle again, disregarding the
Bohemian girls.</p>

<p>“And then the supreme insult of a central heating
system, when every fibre of me yearns for firelight. How
would it be to light a fire of sticks on the carpet?
Would your grandmother mind?”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t think so,” murmured Merle. “It’s only
Aubusson, and she’s a reasonable woman, and you could
always explain to her that you were being the Swiss
Family Robinson.”</p>

<p>“Or Robinson Crusoe. Why, do you suppose, are
shipwrecked islanders always called Robinson? Is
it something wild and primitive that lies in the
name?”</p>

<p>“You know,” Merle suggested gently, “it’s not
necessary to be quite so garrulous, to convince me that
you want to hear about Stuart Heron.”</p>

<p>Peter gave in: “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“A millionaire.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nuisance. Is he sensitive about it? No,
he doesn’t give me the impression of being sensitive
about anything. He’s hard and polished and invulnerable;
Achilles without the heel.”</p>

<p>“Three months’ treatment, and you’ll be crying
aloud that he’s all heel and no Achilles.”</p>

<p>Nicole entered with the tea equipage, containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
much of chased silver; and conversation was for a
moment suspended.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Peter should not have risen from bed
to-day,” severely. “She must surely be fatigued after
so late an evening.”</p>

<p>“I was one of those who left early,” Peter mendaciously
assured the old woman, of whom she stood in
distinct awe.</p>

<p>“Nicole, you’ve forgotten the cream, and Mdlle.
Peter is here. You know her love of cream is only
equalled by her hatred of cows.”</p>

<p>Nicole looked respectfully incredulous: “Surely not,
Mademoiselle. But if it were not for the good kind cows,
what would Mademoiselle put in her tea?”</p>

<p>“I <em>don’t</em> put cows in my tea,” Peter protested unhappily.
And as Nicole, with many chucklings, withdrew,
“Merle, why do you hold me up to scorn before
your staff? And I want more about Stuart&mdash;Heron,
did you say?”</p>

<p>“Awfully Heron. They all are. And quite indecently
rich. He has a mother, and three uncles, and
a married sister, and some cousins&mdash;pretty girls. Family
existing for the worship of Stuart, sole son of the house
of Heron. And all things bright and beautiful, all
things great and small, all things wise and wonderful,
the Herons have them all. I don’t know much more
about them, except presents; they’re for ever giving
each other presents; costly trifles, such as a villa on the
Riviera, or a Rolls-Royce motor, or a new hothouse, or
a sackful of pink diamonds. Whenever you go there,
Mrs. Heron is sure to say: ‘Oh, let me show you the
chocolate-coloured page-boy that Stuart gave me
because he scored a goal at football’; or ‘do help me
think of a present for my brother-in-law, it’s the anniversary
of his wife’s death. Last time I gave him
twenty-four pairs of silk pyjamas sewn with seed-pearls;
do you suppose he would like the Only Orinoco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Orchid? I hear you can get it for five hundred
guineas.’”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ridiculous, and pass the cake,” laughed
Peter. “Besides, all this doesn’t explain Stuart.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about Stuart; of course I was
taken there as a child, but then&mdash;&mdash;” Merle’s eyes grew
large and wistful, “I wasn’t a child; I was a French doll,
in beautiful, expensive clothes, and not allowed to
romp with the other children. So I suppose Stuart
despised me. In fact, he told me as much last night;
that since we’ve been grown-up he has avoided me for
fear I should break. He’s only three years down from
Oxford.”</p>

<p>“So young? I took him for about thirty.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five, I believe.”</p>

<p>“He mentioned Oxford&mdash;isn’t Nicole going to bring
that cream?&mdash;but I doggedly refused to take notice.
’Varsity is the one subject I will not discuss with the
initiated; I pronounce Magdalen as God meant it to
be pronounced, mix up dons with proctors, and earn for
myself undying contempt. So it’s better left alone.”</p>

<p>Nicole entered with the cream, and the intimation
that Monsieur Heron desired to speak with Mademoiselle
des Essarts on the telephone.</p>

<p>“The game commences in earnest,” laughed Merle.
“But I don’t want to get up. You answer it,
Peter.”</p>

<p>Peter, nothing loath, ran downstairs to the boudoir,
and replaced Madame des Essarts at the mouthpiece:
“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello&mdash;look here,” came Stuart’s unmistakable
tones from the other end; tones veiling with the
typical Oxford accent a curious eagerness as of a dog
forever worrying and shaking a bone. “Look here,
how’s my mother?”</p>

<p>“I’m not good at arithmetic.”</p>

<p>“Your grandmother has asked me three times, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
feel I ought to have known. I said ‘quite well, thanks,’
but now I come to think of it, she isn’t. Would it be
the right thing to ring off, and ring up again to contradict
the statement.”</p>

<p>“It would be easier on the whole to cure your mother,
and get it right that way.”</p>

<p>“I say, it isn’t Merle. It’s you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me. Merle’s lying down.”</p>

<p>A pause. Then a chuckle from the other end.</p>

<p>“I trust you have recovered from the fatigues of the
dance, Peter. I recollect that you were among the last
to go.”</p>

<p>She assured him politely that she was suffering from
no ill-effects, and trusted he was the same. And she
passed over the use of her Christian name.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, you two girls? Irish-stew
of the night before? Have I come in yet?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t come in.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> coming in,” something very like a threat in
the assurance. “I’m in already. Well in. Merle told
me about the projected Triumvirate.”</p>

<p>Peter sped an indignant glance towards the absent
Merle, for not informing her of this breach of faith;
and a look of defiance at Stuart, who could not see it,
for daring to laugh, which he wasn’t.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I had a purpose in ’phoning,” he continued;
“though it would be splendid to say I’d rung
up for no reason whatever. Will you ask Merle if she’ll
come with me to a dance at the Cecil, next Tuesday
evening, and bring her little friend.”</p>

<p>Peter refused to rise to such a palpable throw.
“Tickets?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got them. Four. Can you provide another
male of some sort?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Merle. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She returned to find Merle being cherished by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
grandmother, so that a careful version of the foregoing
invitation needed to be given:</p>

<p>“Mr. Heron is making up a party, and hopes we will
join him; and at the same time benefit a charity in which
he is interested.”</p>

<p>Madame des Essarts gave the scheme her gracious
acquiescence. “He doubtless wishes to revenge himself
for last night,” she mused approvingly; “but it is a
somewhat hurried courtesy.” For there existed nothing
in which she was so punctilious as in these social accounts
of give and take; accounts which Merle insisted were
as carefully noted and balanced as any butcher’s or
baker’s. So much debit, so much credit; a nice perception
of how many teas given went to cancel one
luncheon taken. So now:</p>

<p>“If you are to invite another gentleman, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon enfant</i>,
it must be Mr. St. Quentin; you remember he motored
us to Ranelagh.” Madame touched Peter’s cheek
lightly with her hand, besought her not to tire Merle or
herself with too much conversation, and rustled away,
leaving in her train a faint swish and perfume. Whereupon
Peter re-edited truthfully the duologue.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Merle, why did you tell him about the trio, and&mdash;and
all that rot?”</p>

<p>“Rot?”</p>

<p>“He thinks so. He probably thinks it&mdash;oh, girlish!”</p>

<p>“He’s going to count,” said Merle. “And ...
<span class="lock">Peter&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Three is a funny shape,” the younger girl admitted
slowly. “I think it might mean two and one. And I
think, Peter, we shall have to settle, you and I, to be
square with each other, in the triangle.”</p>

<p>“What a ghastly geometrical figure: If the
square ABCD standing on the base of the triangle
<span class="lock">XYZ&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>But Merle was not laughing. “We must agree to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
talk things out, and always get them clear, even if it
should mean disloyalty to Stuart. Because I believe
he’s the strongest.”</p>

<p>Peter considered this a moment, while she emptied
the cream-jug into her cup. “Yes,” she decided at
length. “But we’ll tell him that you and I are going
to keep the path unblocked between us. It will be
fairer; and save him from blundering.”</p>

<p>“He won’t blunder,” Merle prophesied. “And I
think, too, that he’s capable of calling a taxi.”</p>

<p>Peter laughed:</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten the taxis; of course, they were the
original means of bringing him in. But I rather wonder
what he hopes to find.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smaller">THE SHAPE OF THREE</span></h3>


<p>The shape began to assert itself already on the
way to the Cecil. Merle, Peter and Stuart
discovered that their three-cornered talk
flashed forth with uncommon swiftness and brilliancy,
as if drawing inspiration one from the other; that a
spirit and being came alive that belonged not to any
two of them, nor yet to any one, but could only be
borne of just that conjunction of three. So that they
were palpitating with eagerness to continue exploration
in the kingdom which their magical number had thrown
open to them, when Mark St. Quentin, symbol of a
world without meanings, met them, as arranged, in the
ballroom.</p>

<p>As far as St. Quentin was concerned, the evening
proved a failure, strongly reminding him of a phase in
his rather lonely childhood, when elder brothers and
sisters used to glory in the flaunting of their “secrets.”
Though of just what these miraculous “secrets” consisted
he could never discover. Nor could he discover
now what was the curious excitement that seemed to
quiver in his alternate partners; and he was certainly
baffled by the bewildering fashion of their talk. As well
he might be; for Peter and Merle, dizzied by the
constant change and interchange of male involved by
quartette, occasionally allowed their separate manners
to overlap, with merely amusing results when Stuart
received the St. Quentin dregs, but absolutely fatal
when St. Quentin was by mistake driven to cope with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
some startling turn of phrase that should have been
Stuart’s portion.</p>

<p>They were being shockingly ill-bred, the three; not
a doubt of it. But a hardness of heart and an oblivion
of manners descends upon those who, on Tom Tiddler’s
Ground, are picking up gold and silver, towards those
incapable of perceiving the alluring glitter; and St.
Quentin was finally reduced to concentrate his hopes
upon supper, which meal he fondly anticipated might
“draw them all together a bit.” Also, a man of little
imagination, he ascribed the dreary void within him on
contemplating the Tiddlerites, as due to hunger. So
that when Stuart announced carelessly after the eighth
dance: “Had about enough now, haven’t we?” he so
far forgot himself as to expostulate with some fervour:</p>

<p>“Oh, I say. But I thought we were stopping on for
supper, anyway.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” replied Stuart. “But my partners seem
rather anxious to get home.”&mdash;Merle looked astonished,
but understood that she was expected to play up to
some dark sub-current of intention.</p>

<p>“Grandmaman did beg me not to be late,” demurely.
Which happened to be true.</p>

<p>“But Miss Kyndersley,” St. Quentin turned with
dying hopes to Peter; “won’t you stay and have
supper?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t, if Merle doesn’t.” Peter, not in
the mood as yet to renounce gaiety, was inclined to be
indignant with Stuart for his ill-disguised anxiety
to quit.</p>

<p>“A jolly little supper,” wailed the odd man out,
seeing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté</i> and lobster slipping irrevocably through his
fingers.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the hotel rose another slight
discussion: “I’ll see the ladies home; it’s on my
way,” from Stuart.</p>

<p>“Oh, <span class="lock">but&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s on my way,” firmly. And he had hailed a taxi,
for which vehicles he certainly possessed magnetic
attractions, had helped in Merle and Peter, and had
given the address at Lancaster Gate, before St. Quentin
was allowed a chance to proffer services. As the latter
stood beneath the awninged steps, watching the swift
departure, every line of face and figure seemed to
quiver forth in resentful unison: “A jolly little
supper....”</p>

<p>The car shot round the corner. Stuart let down the
window and leant out: “Drive to the Billet-doux,” he
commanded curtly, giving the name of a celebrated
little French restaurant on the border-line between
fashion and Bohemia.</p>

<p>Peter laughed, understanding; and because his
methods amused her. But Merle gasped in some
disturbance.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Stuart. “But it was essential to get
rid of him, wasn’t it? I don’t mean him personally,
but any other existent fourth.”</p>

<p>“But he was of our party,” Merle rebuked him
gravely, conscious of being alone in her defence of good
manners.</p>

<p>“I think not,” laughed Stuart; “merely a stage
property.”</p>

<p>They drew up before the quaint white hostelry in
Soho; set off by its dark and murky surroundings, and
proclaiming aloud its aloofness from these, by the
ostentatious guardianship of two commissionaires.</p>

<p>Passing through the swing doors, Merle was caught
up by the tumult of voices and ring of glass within;
forgot to be prim and censorious; gave herself over
entirely to the joy of this unexpected, and&mdash;as far as
Madame des Essarts was concerned&mdash;forbidden truancy.</p>

<p>So they came for the first time to the Billet-doux,
destined to prove one of the permanent backgrounds to
their triangular career. And the austere and melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Spanish waiter who assisted them to uncloak, did not
for a moment guess how he was to be puzzled by the
alternate qualities and quantities of their future
comings; merely noticed that the party seemed in
excellent spirits, and that the gentleman spent commendably
little time and breath in his selection of the
supper. And here again the girls silently approved.</p>

<p>Peter leant forward across the table: “There’s
something to be settled without further delay,” she
announced, half in mockery, and withal letting a tinge
of earnest invade her tones. “It’s tactless to mention
it, but&mdash;you’re a millionaire, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Stuart assented, very ashamed.</p>

<p>“We’ve agreed to forgive,” Peter went on, “on the
condition that you let us forget. No chucking about of
gold purses to the populace, mark you. As long as you
never permit us to see more than two sovereigns at a
time, our three-ship shall endure. But the rest of your
vast fortune, and all your motor-cars and boot-trees,
you must hide in mattresses and banks. Is that understood?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you make it guineas,” he pleaded unhappily.
And in consideration of his quenched demeanour, they
agreed to expand the limits by a florin.</p>

<p>“I suppose you had better know the worst,” he continued
gloomily, helping them to varieties of sardines
that, like Diogenes, dwelt mainly in tubs. “I’m a
diamond-merchant.”</p>

<p>Merle burst out laughing. “Oh, Stuart, how comical!
Do you wear a silk hat?”</p>

<p>“<em>And</em> a face to match. You must invade the offices
one day, and see me in the act.”</p>

<p>“You take it seriously, then?”</p>

<p>“Desperately. Notice the absorbed face of a small
boy playing at grown-ups; if he were laughing all the
time, he wouldn’t be enjoying the game.”</p>

<p>“But if we really do bear down upon you, will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
give us a sign that it’s all right? Because otherwise I’m
terrified of the ‘business face.’”</p>

<p>“One sign ye shall have, and no more. After that
I’ll expect you to play also, and take proper interest in
diamonds, and listen prettily to the Khalif,&mdash;it doesn’t
matter about the One-eyed Calendar.”</p>

<p>And here Merle demanded explanations, which were
midway interrupted by a wail of despair from Peter;
she had somehow contrived to mix her implements so
that whichever way she worked it, the fish-knife would
be left for dessert. Stuart looked for enlightenment at
Merle:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t she know? Has no one told her? Are we
to pretend not to see?”</p>

<p>“She springs from the people,” Merle answered his
aside. “The kind that wear curl-papers and barrows.
I’ll tell you all about it when we’re alone.”</p>

<p>... Stuart and Merle, if only in jest; and Peter the
outsider. Not for one moment could the flexible triangle
retain its form.</p>

<p>“Let it be clearly understood,” broke in Peter,
defiantly holding out the wrong glass, that wine might
be poured into it, “that except for the benefit of
Fernand, I refuse to be: ‘and your little friend
also.’”</p>

<p>“Who is Fernand?” from Stuart.</p>

<p>Merle owned to an elder brother who dwelt in Paris.
“Peter and I were once upon a time allowed to travel
alone from England to the South of France, to join
Grandmaman in Nice. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En route</i>, I gave Peter a party
consisting of Fernand, and a first-class <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wagon-lit</i>.”</p>

<p>“In juxtaposition?” murmured Stuart. Peter, for
fear of Merle’s little reserves, flashed him a glance of
warning. The shape had altered again.... Obviously
it was impossible to keep intimacy of speech and spirit
moving between more than two points; the idea was to
spin it so swiftly from one to another and then on, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to give the appearance of all three simultaneously
involved.</p>

<p>Peter took up the narrative:</p>

<p>“Fernand Alfonso des Essarts, the essence of decorum
and propriety, met us at the Gare du Nord, and escorted
us across Paris. He carried a big box of chocolates for
Merle, and a smaller one for her little friend also. He
conveyed to Merle the compliments of all her unknown
relatives in Paris; and she cast down her eyes, transformed
to an embodiment of the virginal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune fille</i>,
convent-fresh and dewy, and conveyed to him the
compliments of all his unknown relatives in London.
And they thanked each other separately for each one.
In this wise did they continue to converse. He asked
her if she were thirsty&mdash;‘And you also, Mademoiselle,
you are thirsty?’ ‘And I also, Monsieur, I am
thirsty,’ sez I, likewise convent-fresh and dewy. He
displayed polite interest in her progress at the piano&mdash;‘And
you also, Mademoiselle, you play the piano?’
‘And I also, Monsieur, I play the piano.’&mdash;I don’t,
by the way, Stuart; it’s quite all right. And Fernand
surveyed his beautiful boots, and probably thought of
his beautiful grisette, neglected that evening for the
sake of these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embêtantes</i> young English misses. And
with an inspiration he asked Merle if she had <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal-de-mer</i>
in crossing&mdash;‘And you also, Mademoiselle, you had
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal-de-mer</i> in crossing?’ ‘And I also, Monsieur, I had
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal-de-mer</i> in crossing. Very!’ The word too much
did it, and Fernand addressed me no more.”</p>

<p>“I hope the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wagon-lit</i> proved a compensation for
your temporary effacement,” laughed Stuart.</p>

<p>He sat opposite them, as it were one pitted against
two. And the girls marvelled anew that aught with the
looks and costume and bearing of conventional man-about-town,
eye-glass and knowledge of the wine-list,
should yet have caught the melody of their pipes, and
revealed in response his own nimble goat-legs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
proximity of the mirror which enlarged their number to
six, lent a grotesque flavour to the scene, allowing each
of the players the illusion of being at the same time
spectator; placing the table, with its shining napery
and silver, tumbled shimmer of whitebait, and dull red
Burgundy in the glasses, outside and apart from reality.
Stuart, catching at one moment the reflected eyes of his
companions, toasted them silently in phantom wine ...
and it needed a curious effort, a tug of the will, before
they could recall their glances from the three puppets
in looking-glass-land, to meet, each of them, their two
companions in the flesh. The light and stir of the
restaurant, the drifting brilliant figures from one
crowded room to another, the gay groups, talking,
laughing, were all, as it were, subordinated, like supers
in a stage set. So the solicitous waiter, hovering, might
have been stolen from some sinister Spanish masque of
passion and hatred. From an outer chamber, drifted
wailing snatches of violin-play. The ghost of Mark
St. Quentin glided into the vacant seat to Peter’s right.
“A jolly little supper,” he murmured reproachfully....</p>

<p>“Three coffees, black,” Stuart ordered of the waiter;
“And&mdash;green Chartreuse, both of you? I think so;
three green Chartreuses.” He did not consult their
tastes, hoping to gauge them accurately by intuition,
or else luck. He held a match to their cigarettes; and,
reverting to the topic of their journey, suggested that
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wagon-lit</i> might be rather a nice domestic animal:
“A tame red <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wagon-lit</i> with trustful brown eyes.
I wonder if my wife would let me keep one in the back-garden,
among the washing.”</p>

<p>Merle was overcome by a vision of the future wife
of the diamond-merchant hanging up the diamond-merchant’s
pants on a clothes-line, every Monday
morning.</p>

<p>“Just fancy,” Stuart burst forth, “the indignity of
having to ask permission before one could keep a fox-terrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
or a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wagon-lit</i>. I can <em>not</em> understand the state of
mind which leads a man to marriage: the eternal sucking
of the same orange, when there are thousands for his
plucking.”</p>

<p>His tone was of the lightest, but Peter understood
that it veiled a warning. And she was conscious of a
sudden rage that he should deem a warning necessary.</p>

<p>“Prince of Orange,” she mocked him; “you
probably waste your kingdom.”</p>

<p>But he boasted: “Not so. For I am aware of the
exact instant just before the juice is all spent and the
skin will taste bitter in my mouth. And then I cast
away my orange and gather another. There are so
many in the grove that sometimes indeed I am tempted
to leave one half-sucked, to try the flavour of the next.
But I don’t ... I don’t.”</p>

<p>Merle put in: “You are speaking symbolically.”</p>

<p>“I am,” smiling at her&mdash;his leprechaun smile.</p>

<p>“And what of the pips? do you swallow them in the
process?”</p>

<p>“Rather than spit them, yes. I likewise suck
silently, and with great haste, greediness and appreciation.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Peter, into her curling smoke-wreaths,
“if the orange has any views on the subject....”</p>

<p>Stuart heard: “That depends on the thickness of its
skin.”</p>

<p>“Their rejected skins shall go to make your pathway
to Hell. And the whole way ye shall slip ignominiously.”</p>

<p>“Rather say I shall slide gloriously.”</p>

<p>“And bump at the bottom?”</p>

<p>“There are great virtues, even in a bump at the
bottom, to those who understand the art of swift
recovery.”</p>

<p>Peter mused on this, while remarking idly that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pale glint of Chartreuse held much more of evil than
the frank winking serpent-green of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crême-de-menthe</i>.</p>

<p>“Are you never natural?” she queried suddenly,
recalling the man to joyous sparring, from his tender
admiration of Merle’s side-face, which, one among a
thousand, really merited the higher appellation of
profile.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. What am I, natural? or you,
or anyone else? something that sleeps and eats and
walks, and never enquires. Not of such stuff are born
the Orange-Suckers, the Hairpin-Visionists.”</p>

<p>“Hairpin-Visionists?” chorus of attracted femininity.</p>

<p>He explained: “If, whatever you are doing, you are
able to project yourself into the future, and from that
point look back again to the present, you can get your
outlines clear, see where each step is leading you,
obtain a sense of proportion and values on the incident.
And that mental process follows the curves of an
ordinary hairpin, starting at one of the points&mdash;then
forward&mdash;and back again. D’you see?” he traced the
diagram with his fingers on the table-cloth.</p>

<p>“Then you always live your life backwards, from
some imaginary spot seven or eight months hence?
What a grotesque looking-glass existence!”</p>

<p>“The Billet-doux is lowering its lights,” remarked
Stuart. And called for the bill. They had supped
luxuriously, and drunken of wine that lay cradled in
straw, a white muffler about its slender neck. So that
the reckoning amounted to two pounds three and twopence.
Stuart was about to fling down three pieces of
gold&mdash;when he remembered....</p>

<p>Here was a quandary indeed.</p>

<p>Leaning across to Merle, he murmured in confidential
and embarrassed tones: “I say, I’m rather short of
cash; forgive the awful cheek&mdash;could you lend me half
a crown?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Very gravely she produced the coin: “It’s quite
all right; please don’t bother about returning it.” The
notion of a Heron short of cash was truly delightful.</p>

<p>“Peter,” snuggling her head sleepily against the older
girl’s shoulder, when they had taken their seats in the
home-bound taxi. “Peter, are we going to like him?
I believe we are.”</p>

<p>Peter looked at Stuart&mdash;and surprised a rather lorn
and out-of-it expression on his face. There had been
unconscious cruelty, perhaps even coquetry, in Merle’s
gesture and appeal; emphasizing his position on the
opposite seat; their snug drowsy security in the
fortress he was attempting to storm from without.</p>

<p>“You realize that, don’t you?” said Peter, hammering
upon the nail; “that Merle and I talk to each
other; really talk. And that we’ll allow you no
quarter.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the danger-signal.” Stuart smiled,
and ceased to resemble the lonely millionaire of fiction.
The triangle for the moment was clearly isosceles: a
short line connecting points X and Z at the base, while
Y lay infinitely remote at the apex.</p>

<p>“It is going to be difficult,” thought Y exultantly.</p>

<p>For Stuart was nauseated by the rose-path.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the pride of them was like wind sweeping through
the hair. Pride of youth and good looks and active
limb. Pride in their need of one another, and their
power to stand alone withal. Most of all, pride of brain,
that could leap from point to point, nor ever lose a foothold;
propound subtlety upon subtlety, each of the
three eager to give the corkscrew its final twist, till
towards the seventh evolution they would laughingly
give up, and slowly unwind again. Brains that could be
adapted to any circumstances and any company; wring
enjoyment from the most unpromising material; brains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that forgot not, so that reference became a language,
incomprehensible save to those who had invented the
cipher. Brains responsive, electric, in perfect working
order. Pride of brain, surely as splendid a thing as the
more usual pride of body that waits on youth.</p>

<p>The trio, definitely established, possessed a spirit of
its own; its actions were wilful and indeterminate, and
none could know its soul save by inspiration. It was
built of cross-moods, cross-stimulations; and it owned
no leader nor follower, but changed its several parts
from moment to moment. A thing of fine complexity,
the trio, that could adjust itself to the shock of any
outside problem or weariness,&mdash;in fact, take unto and
into itself these same problems and wearinesses, and
make of them part of the whole, subjugated to its
domination. And its god was the unknown, and its
fear the Inevitable, and retrospect its recreation, and in
the Hairpin Vision lay its safety, and in sex its slumbering
danger.</p>

<p>The Spanish waiter, of a romantic disposition, took
interest in the Señor and two Señoritas who came so
frequently to the Billet-doux; and wondered when the
former would begin to evince a preference. The Spanish
waiter, only human, went so far as to rejoice in the
sight of Peter and Stuart supping alone; since himself
had begun to regard Merle with a more than waiterly
eye. He was both puzzled and furious, two nights later,
at the entrance of Stuart and Merle. And his bewilderment
knew no bounds, when, having at last decided the
Señoritas were at deadly enmity for their love of the
capricious Señor, Peter and Merle shattered this most
plausible theory by lunching together in perfect harmony
of spirit. The Spanish waiter might stand as the first
of a collection of persons convinced of the madness
of the trio: collection of incidentals to their daily
progress, such as railway-porters, policemen, telephone
operators, grocers, boatmen, parents, rustics and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Baldwin. Collection which Stuart proposed leaving to
the Nation on his death: “each individual to be
labelled with date and circumstance concurrent with
his or her initiation to the belief of our complete
insanity.”</p>

<p>Peter found an instance: “Specimen 41: Respectable
Old Gentleman. March 2nd, 1913. On accidentally
catching sight of Trio solemnly smashing egg at the end
of Euston.”</p>

<p>“You know,” said Merle, “I don’t think he would
have been so bewildered if Stuart hadn’t explained to
him that we always smash eggs at supreme moments of
our career; that we regard it as a religious ceremony;
and that our accompanying chant is taken from Scene I
of Macbeth: “When shall we three meet again?”&mdash;ending:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fare is fowl, and fowl is broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the white and leave for us the yolk.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“It was an impromptu effort,” the author apologized.
“And then he didn’t see why the discovery of the End
of Euston should be a supreme moment, even in the life
of a lunatic.”</p>

<p>Peter could best have enlightened the Respectable
Old Gentleman, to whom stations were stations, neither
more nor less. Euston was her terminus for Thatch
Lane; and on the many occasions that Stuart had
accompanied her thither, they had taken to their hearts
the grim portals and endless echoing approach, the
labyrinth of platform and grey mystery of booking-hall,
the infinite possibilities in its stretching regions and
sinister corners. Very much less than station, when
their whim was to treat it as a nursery of toys; and how
much more than station, when its oppressive personality
foredoomed it as a backcloth for the day when
their mood should be of tragedy. Peter and Stuart
viewed Euston with respect; but regarded it neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>less
as theirs by virtue of understanding, a kingdom
into which even Merle could not stray.</p>

<p>In the balancing whereof&mdash;for Stuart was careful to
dole even kingdoms and secrets with perfect equality
and fairness&mdash;he and Merle were both Insiders of
society, permitting them likewise to be Truants from
society; a privilege Peter lacked, in that one cannot
play truant from a stage one has never entered. But
society, rumour-fed that the charming granddaughter
of Madame des Essarts, and Heron, the fabulously
wealthy young diamond-merchant, were of late to be seen
frequently in company one of the other, society did
approve of this most desirable union; and, furthermore,
did seek to forward it by a system known as “throwing-together.”
Merle and Stuart, meeting on the area-steps
and by the back-doors of society, had no desire
whatsoever for propinquity of the hall-portals and front
drawing-room; so that Merle received with polite
indifference the tidings that Stuart was to be present at
some glittering function; and Stuart went so far as to
refuse invitations to dinner-parties, carefully prepared
with a view to placing him at Merle’s side during three
solid hours of mastication.</p>

<p>Heron and des Essarts; riches and family; youth
and beauty; it was an alliance altogether too suitable,
and the parties involved felt it their bounden duty not
to give it visible encouragement. “I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;have
you made easy for me,” Stuart muttered in his most
clenched voice. Truants of society both, they enjoyed
their truancy as much for what they left behind, as for
what they went to seek.</p>

<p>Peter smiled sometimes, as she reflected how little of
sordid niggling money worries, of harassing debts, of the
snatching hour-to-hour existence that went on in the
Bohemian underworld, was known to those who have
a sufficiency of baths, and travel first-class as a matter
of course. Perversely enough, she hugged to herself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
memory of the few years she had spent on the border-line
between respectability and squalor; was glad they
were hers alone, unshared by Merle or Stuart. Her one-world! ...
had they each a one-world, she mused, as
well as their two-world and their three-world?</p>

<p>She and Merle had not as yet succeeded in locating
the heel of their Achilles. Stuart was hard and ruthless,
that they had agreed in their many confabulations
on the subject; quite without sympathy for weakness
or sentiment of any kind. But signs had betrayed a
vulnerable spot in him, tantalizingly indicated, vanished
as soon as they attempted to follow up the trail. Childish
he certainly was at times. Childish in the quick look
he was wont to throw, angling for approbation, after
the successful performance of what they were pleased to
term a “stunt.” Childishly annoyed at any reference on
their part to the kingdom as it stood before he entered
it. Childishly petulant on an occasion when the girls
took him adventuring in a part of the world unfamiliar
to him, so that initiative fell for once into their hands.
Childishly ill-mannered on another occasion, when
Peter, partly in the spirit of mischief, sought to make a
quartette of trio by the introduction of a new discovery
in the male line. Then Stuart, even as he had done
previously with Mark St. Quentin, uprose mightily in
his wrath, and hurled the unoffending youth from the
topmost battlements into the moat of blackness.
Whereat the girls gave their officious Prætorian clearly
to understand that with them alone lay the orders for
entrance and ejection:</p>

<p>“You were disgustingly rude. You were worse; you
hurt his feelings!&mdash;&mdash;” A furiously indignant Merle,
ivory burning to rose, eyes storm-grey. “You hurt
him,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“It’s not a serious wound,” thus the culprit, coolly.
“You shall go and put balm upon it, Merle. I believe
you keep a balm factory for applying relief to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
endless victims of my ‘disgusting rudeness.’” He
loved to tease Merle, who was soft-hearted.</p>

<p>“It sounds like margarine,” she cried, in distasteful
reference to the balm. And the incident closed on a
laugh.</p>

<p>But childishness was not weakness; nor could it
account for those moments when he seemed mutely to
plead to them for something. And then the memory
would be swept away in a gale of swagger, loud crows of
self-approval,&mdash;accompanied always by a twinkle in
the unwindowed eye, that plainly betrayed amused
knowledge of his own effrontery.</p>

<p>“Just where Stuart suffers,” remarked Peter to Merle,
in a spasm of illumination, “is that his wings of swank
will always be attributed to the uplifting effects of his
money-bags, and condemned accordingly. Whereas
I’m perfectly certain that without a penny he would
still remain as magnificently and serenely confident.
It’s in him, not in his pockets. But he’ll never get a
chance to prove it. And he wears himself out in the
invention of opportunities to wear himself out.”</p>

<p>“The qualities of a Stoic rotting in the bosom of a
millionaire,” reflected the other girl. “He’s rather a
dear,” she added with sudden inconsequence.</p>

<p>Peter surveyed her quizzically: “Quite sound as
yet, are you? No bones broken?”</p>

<p>Merle felt herself: “Heart all right&mdash;thighs&mdash;ankles&mdash;shoulder-blades&mdash;&mdash;Yes,
thanks, I’m perfectly sound
and rather happy. How are you?” politely.</p>

<p>Thus theirs was the advantage, to be able to make
of him a subject for discussion. Stuart knew no such
relief. His search for truth in this double she-encounter
had of necessity to be a solitary quest. Nor did his
previous she-encounters assist him one whit. He could
rely on Merle and Peter to be thoroughly loyal to one
another, and unblushingly disloyal towards him, which
was baffling, by way of a beginning. They showed far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cleverer than the sirens who had previously essayed to
lure his boat to destruction, save when he sought to
compare them with females renownedly intellectual,
when by sheer perversity, the two would present themselves
to his mental conception as capriciously feminine,
exasperating in their swift changes of mood, in their
demands upon him for the impossible, in their conscious
and provoking mystery. No space of time to analyse
them individually as separate Sphinxes for his unravelling.
As yet they were still an undivided problem.</p>

<p>He knew they kept guarded and intact their innermost
chambers of all. Well&mdash;did he not also retain his
one-world? A world in which dwelt Stuart the metaphysician,
who, stronger even than Stuart the leprechaun,
recognized with dismay an ability to slip out of
the trio and its pattern, its march-rhythm and its
corkscrew wit; get glimpses of himself as a bit of a
fool; of the whole edifice they had raised, as absurd,
exaggerated; doubting whether such close comradeship
with two girls, save with the outlook and excuse of
pure masculinity, did not contain an element&mdash;yes,
though he loathed the term, an element of the fantastic?
In fact, when he could add himself to the collection that
was to be left to the nation. But he limited these
glimpses, as being contrary to the rules of the game;
would have denied them himself altogether, had he not
been convinced they added to the fun,&mdash;the fun of
scrambling back, aware he had been outside, a truant
from truancy! The metaphysician went in fear that
the leprechaun would one day lose his scrambling
abilities; that the intellect would predominate over the
sense of worlds beyond the reach of facts. The metaphysician
was wistfully envious of the leprechaun, who
continued to kick up his heels in despite of disapproval.</p>

<p>There likewise dwelt in the one-world a Stuart Heron
known to college friends, such as Oliver Strachey, who
remembered him as the finest classical scholar of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
year; and other men viewing him solely in the light of
a keen sportsman; a fellow good to knock about with;
not much of a talker; inclined to be a bit shattering and
explosive at times, but apologizing for these ebullitions
by a great excess of heartiness afterwards; excess
indeed, for Stuart was apt to over-emphasize his
normality.</p>

<p>Remained Heron the diamond-merchant, who was
perhaps negligible&mdash;perhaps also not.</p>



<p class="tbpara">April this year had stolen some of June’s warm gold,
so that devotees of the river could for once pay homage
to tender mist of green, and mating bird-song. The trio
had been afloat since early hours, before the sun had yet
drunk all the diamond dew from the cobwebs, and
Peter more than once apologized to Stuart for the continual
reminders of his trade that sparkled from every
grass-blade, every opening leaf.</p>

<p>Their boat had pushed first into all the locks, and
shot first out, nose thrust between the slowly widening
gates. They had discovered an island above the broken
glinting shoulder of a weir; and, annexing it for their
own, played Swiss Family Robinson thereon, with great
contentment, save for some slight argument concerning
the parts: “Little Franz for me,” Peter declared,
“because of the rides. Whatever wild animal they
catch, be it ostrich or donkey or tortoise, Arab steed or
earwig, there’s always ‘just room for our little Franz
upon its back.’ Franz has an easy time of it. His
father makes him a quiverful of arrows, and ‘off he
trots, looking like a Cupid,’ That’s me. Stuart, you
shall be the father.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no vocation for impromptu sermons on the
goodness of Heaven in permitting our pigs to find
truffles,” retorted Stuart. “And I want to be ‘my
wilful headstrong Fritz.’ Merle shall be father&mdash;<em>and</em>
mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Merle demurred. They always cast her for the
“mother” parts, she complained, simply because her
hair chose to remain tidier than other people’s. At
which thrust, Peter renounced the entire game, and
decided she wanted to play at hounds-among-the-undergrowth.
Her companions looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“‘The Hound of the d’Urbervilles’? Sleuth-hounds?
Hounds of Low? of Ditch? Hounds of Heaven? Or
just Faithful Hounds? Peter, please specify, and I
might even play at being just one tiny little puppy bloodhound
myself.”</p>

<p>In the end Stuart was the entire pack, and Master of
the Hounds to boot. And then they abandoned this
new sport in favour of the Spanish Armada; sailed
ignited fireships down a backwater, and roused volumes
of sputtering and inarticulate wrath in the bosom of a
mild man of peace whose skiff they had almost set in
flames.</p>

<p>Now, subdued to a more twilit mood, they lie dark
against the quenched amber and pearl of the sunset;
and reviewing their April day, they find it good. Stuart,
in ostentatious proof that he needs no rest from his
Herculean labours with the pole, has allowed Peter
to recline full-length in the punt, her head upon his
knees, the while she lazily smokes a cigarette, and
complains that his bones penetrate the thickness of four
cushions, and hurt the back of her neck.</p>

<p>“Which proves that you are a Princess by birth,”
laughs Merle, squatting, a graceful Dryad, on the
adjoining bank. “You remember the incident of the
pea under the twelve mattresses?”</p>

<p>And now it is that Peter solemnly propounds the
question, as to whether (<i>a</i>) consciousness of swank and
swagger, and (<i>b</i>) consciousness of the irritation produced
in others by swank and swagger, could or could not be
held as mitigating circumstances for aforesaid swank
and swagger?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mitigating circumstances? No, I think not,”
thoughtfully Merle raises a dusky purple grape to her
crimson lips. The colour-scheme thus presented might
have been one of Dulac’s exotic harmonies: blue-green
shadow of the Quarry Woods behind; vivid blue jersey;
bluish lights in the dense black of her hair. “I should
rather say that the consciousness makes one accessory
before the fact.”</p>

<p>Stuart joins in; “The form of the question might be
altered to this: does my personality justify my swank?”
impishly he grins down on the upturned face of Peter
across his knees. He is very unlike a man at these
minutes; gnome, pixie or hobgoblin might claim him
brother.</p>

<p>Peter retorts: “That’s a different thing altogether.
And why limit the problem to yourself? I was talking
generally.”</p>

<p>“Deceive not thyself, my child. A long and careful
study of the differences between male and female intellect
has finally convinced me that the latter is incapable
of generalities, of completely impersonal discussion.
Follow the wriggling rivers of her speech backwards
to their source, and you will discover the Subjective
Sea. But do you know,” with renewed earnestness;
“I believe my personality <em>does</em> justify my swank.
Otherwise you wouldn’t put up with me as you do. And
if it justifies my swank, then my swank is non-existent.
Swank is a thing which proceeds from a misconception
of one’s status.”</p>

<p>“Is his swank non-existent?” murmurs Merle to
the swimming atoms in a last slanting sunray; “Oh,
I trow not.”</p>

<p>“‘Swagger’ is slightly different again.” Stuart is
enjoying himself immensely. “It is the outward and
visible manifestation of the swank that resides in the
soul. The ‘agger’ in fact. But your question respecting
the mitigating circumstances of our consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
thereof, is rot, my dear Peter. Because swagger <em>is</em>
consciousness, to start with. Shall we paddle her home,
Merle?”</p>

<p>The haze of evening has crept up, white-footed, from
the south. A Dryad moves from the bank, seats herself
beside a Faun. The rhythmic dip and swirl of their
paddles dies away into silence.</p>



<p class="tbpara">... And the pride of them was like wind sweeping
through the hair; pride in their ability to maintain
without disaster this strangely exhilarating friendship
of one and two; flaunt it in the very face of the Inevitable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">DIAMONDS ARE TRUMPS</span></h3>


<p>“I want to go a-maying,” Peter announced. Nor
was her ardour abated when Merle reminded her
that April was still in its heyday.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference if the spirit of May-day
be in me. The weather is a sheer intoxication, and calls
for revelry. It’s not your birthday by any chance, is
it?”</p>

<p>“If you can wait three <span class="lock">weeks&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I can’t! I can’t! I want to go a-maying.”</p>

<p>Merle looked at her helplessly. “But one doesn’t
go a-maying in Regent Street,” she protested; “if
you mean garlands and queens. I’ll crown you with
hawthorn from Gerrard’s, if you insist, but the expense
will be enormous. Or we’ll catch a cart-horse and plait
its tail with red, white, and blue. <em>Or</em> I’ll treat you to
an ice-cream soda at Fuller’s. You can choose between
these rural delights.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Stuart?” Peter demanded suddenly. “I
haven’t seen or heard of him for about a week.”
One of Stuart’s habits was the treatment of each curt
farewell as final, leaving his companions in a pleasant
state of uncertainty as to his next summons to fellowship.
“Where’s Stuart? P’raps it’s <em>his</em> birthday.
’Tisn’t mine, I know. Merle, what do you say to a grand
un-birthday festival? Stuart shall take us into the
country to toss cowslip balls. We’ll rout him out from
his Aladdin’s Cave. Who wants diamonds in springtime,
in <span class="lock">springtime&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘The only pretty ring-time,’” Merle added. “So
you’re wrong about the diamonds.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go and look at his pretty rings.” Peter hesitated,
came to a full-stop opposite one of Liberty’s
windows, a tawny riot of gold and amber and copper
tints. “Perhaps we’d better not,” she decided; “I
hate the sort of female who can’t leave a man alone in
business hours. And I hate still more the ponderous
business face with which he receives her pretty importunities.”</p>

<p>“But Stuart!” laughed Merle. “You can surely
trust Stuart enough to believe there is no City-spell on
earth can hold him captive. Besides, he begged us to invade
his premises one day and see him play at diamond-merchants.
Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“In a silk hat; so he did. Come along then.” Peter
wavered no longer, but hailed a Holborn ’bus, and
followed by Merle, scrambled to the top. She was
right about the weather: the warm air was a-stir with
lilac promise, and passing faces gave evidence of spring-cleaning
within, a more potent and magical spring-cleaning
than ever achieved by mop and broom.</p>

<p>“I feel about six and a half,” Merle confessed gaily,
as with a delighted sense of exploration they spelt out
“Heron and Carr, Diamond-merchants, first floor,”
among a bewilderment of brass plates, and mounted
lightly the wide stone staircase.</p>

<p>“We want Mr. Stuart Heron, please,” to the office
boy who answered their summons; and again, “We
want Mr. Stuart Heron,” as a preoccupied clerk came
slowly forward.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stuart?” The man looked reluctant. “Is it
important?”</p>

<p>“Awfully important,” said Peter gravely. She was
wondering what would be the man’s attitude if she
explained that the youngest partner of the house was
required for the purposes of an un-birthday celebration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>They were conducted through two or three apartments,
containing nothing more thrilling than cupboards
and clerks, so that Merle assumed the jewels
were kept in glittering caverns below; and then ushered
into an anteroom, formal and luxurious, in which were
already seated several applicants for royal favour,
grave men and grey, all.</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Stuart is engaged. What name shall
I say?” The confidential clerk appeared curiously
disapproving of their presence.</p>

<p>“Got your card-case, Merle?”</p>

<p>Of course Merle had her card-case. And a card.
And white kid gloves with which to present it. More
than could be said for Peter.</p>

<p>Their guide withdrew, having first motioned the
girls to deep leather arm-chairs, into which they sank
and were obliterated. The silence of the room became
thick and muffled. A clock ticked ponderously from
the chimney-piece. The assembled veterans made no
sound, with the exception of one who played nervously
with his feet, advancing these by slow stages towards
one another, and then scurrying them apart, as if fearful
of being caught in the act. Peter watched him, fascinated.
It was fully ten minutes before hurried steps
approached the door....</p>



<p class="tbpara">There had been changes in the firm of Heron and Carr
since Stuart entered it, three years before. Uncle Arthur
had embraced the opportunity to retire from business.
Derwent Heron was growing old, and absented himself
frequently from the office: Baldwin&mdash;well, Baldwin at
the best of times was useful mostly as an ornament.
Thus it befell that a great deal of responsibility fell on
the shoulders of the new partner. Nor was Stuart
averse to this. He was right when he said that a game
lost its value unless played in all seriousness. On the
whole he made few mistakes, though his lucky star ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the risk, from overwork, of becoming somewhat frayed
at the edges. Frequently he deplored the difficulty of
truly reckless gambling, with that officious orbit fore-dooming
him ever to success. Of late, certain events
had decided him to buy in a vast amount of stock,
giving mostly bills in exchange. Then, like a bolt from
the blue, one Antoine Gobert, from Venezuela, made his
sensational announcement: no less than the discovery
of a cheap preparation for the making of diamonds.
The days following this revelation were fraught with the
greatest strain to the merchants in the trade. It was
generally acknowledged that in the case of Heron and
Carr the crash consequent upon proof of Gobert’s
integrity would resound loudest. It was unlucky for the
youngest diamond-merchant in London that he should
have been buying in with such rapidity and vigour.
His elders shook their grey heads over Stuart, but consulted
him notwithstanding, in this period of crisis; an
unconscious tribute to certain brilliant strokes made by
the firm within the past three years.</p>

<p>Gobert, having flung his bombshell, did not seem
inclined to part too easily with the mysteries of his
prescription. Rumour was busy, and prices fluctuated
wildly. With difficulty was a panic averted. Stuart
firmly declared the magician a fraud; continued to
assert it contrary to the opinions of the majority, older
men, men of deep experience. It was felt that some
decisive step would have to be taken, before Gobert
should make newspaper babble of his secret. Already
journalism was on the scent; and once known, the
romance of the thing would cause it to be gobbled
greedily by the public. So the wizard was approached;
discreetly sounded; finally, an offer made to him by
Sir Fergus Macpherson, of the firm of Grey, Macpherson
and Sons, well-known diamond-merchants. An offer of
twenty thousand pounds for the purpose of private
experiment; a slip of paper, containing the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ingredients of the manufacture, to be placed, in token
of good faith, at the Bank of England. Gobert refused
twenty thousand pounds. Not enough. Fifty thousand
then? So be it, fifty thousand. The money was paid
over, and the experiments started. Then, somehow a
doubt of Gobert arose and grew. And that very day,
April the 16th, it was finally decided that the envelope
was to be opened, the miracle laid bare. If genuine&mdash;so
much the worse for dealers in diamonds; so much the
worse for Stuart Heron in particular. The issue would
not have loomed in his eyes so stupendous, were it not
that he felt his credit with Derwent and Arthur at
stake. The firm had relied on his judgment. So that,
sitting in earnest consultation with Sir Fergus and a
certain Rupert Rosenstein, his mouth was set in sterner
lines than his age warranted, and a deep frown lay
between his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, Sir <span class="lock">Fergus&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>The confidential clerk entered noiselessly, and handed
him a card: ‘Miss Merle des Essarts.’</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Two young ladies, Mr. Heron. Said it was important.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;very well. Say that I’m coming at once.”</p>

<p>But it was several minutes before Sir Fergus rose to
take leave. And then there were so many matters that
clamoured for his brain’s attention; all overshadowed
by a persistently recurring vision of a factory ... ten
factories ... a thousand factories; men working;
swarms of busy little figures; myriads of tiny white
crystals the result of their labours,&mdash;the result of a few
lines of writing that awaited the evening’s examination.
Glittering crystals, produced in such quantities as to
flood the universe like dewfall ... pretty little crystals,
but utterly valueless.</p>

<p>Stuart straightened his shoulders. No good anticipating
the worst. He opened the door of the anteroom:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
“Ah, Digby, I wanted to see you,”&mdash;and he of the
wandering feet looked gratified.</p>

<p>Peter and Merle were waiting, rather impatiently, at
the far end of the apartment. Some of their April
joyousness had been swamped by the oppressive atmosphere
surrounding them. The sunshine, creeping
through the heavily curtained window, was merely
metallic here. So that they greeted Stuart with relief.</p>

<p>“The face is perfect,” laughed Peter. “All we expected,
and more. And now please take it off. Or is it
merely semi-detached?”</p>

<p>Stuart did not reply. Nor was there perceptible
alteration in his demeanour. But Peter was too amused
by his garments of black decorum, to note that to-day
they were something more than skin-deep.</p>

<p>“But, oh, Stuart, where’s the hat? You promised
us the hat! Don’t say you’ve left it in the hall?”</p>

<p>He turned to Merle; and though he spoke courteously,
his thoughts seemed very far away.</p>

<p>“My clerk told me it was important. Are you in any
trouble? Or&mdash;can I?”&mdash;he hesitated, obviously waiting
an excuse for their presence. And Merle’s cheeks
began to burn.</p>

<p>“We&mdash;it isn’t really important,” she faltered. “I
only&mdash;we thought&mdash;&mdash;” oh, to be safely down the steps
and out in the street! How could she say to this
stranger: “We wanted you to come a-maying because
it is April.” The thrill of primroses in the air had
dwindled to a pin-point of triviality.</p>

<p>“We wondered whether you would care to join us
for a day in the country,” she finished at last, lamely.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’m afraid it’s quite out of the question
to-day.” He appeared to realize dimly that something
more was expected of him. His eye fell on Digby, eager
for attention. The confidential clerk entered: “You’re
wanted on the telephone, sir. Mr. Grey.” “All right,
Lewis; ask him to hold the line,” alert response now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
his voice; and he had already turned to the door, when
he remembered his visitors. “We must be going,” said
Merle quickly. He looked relieved. “Ah, then you’ll
excuse me, I know. We’re rather rushed. Would you
care to have a look round the place?”&mdash;he signalled
to Lewis to wait, in case his services should be required
as cicerone. “There’s nothing much to see, though.
No treasure-vaults,” with a groping attempt to resume
the language of which he had so patently mislaid the
cipher.</p>

<p>And Merle, likewise clutching at her rags of self-respect,
responded with a forced laugh: “You don’t
make the diamonds, then?”</p>

<p>“No,” Stuart’s tones were somewhat grim. “We
don’t make the diamonds.” He paused. Then, with a
quick “Good-bye,” went to answer the telephone
summons. “I’ll see you directly, Digby,” thrown out
on his way to the door. Baldwin Carr appeared at
another entrance: “Has Macpherson gone, Stuart?
Derwent wanted to speak to you&mdash;&mdash;” “Right! when
I’ve polished off Grey.” What <em>was</em> the matter with all
these men, that the wrinkle lay so deep between their
eyebrows?</p>

<p>Baldwin glanced in some surprise at the figures of
Peter and Merle, standing irresolutely by the window.
Then returned to his private office.</p>

<p>The confidential clerk showed them out. A swinging
door presented them with a snatch of telephonic conversation:
“Yes, it’s Mr. Stuart Heron&mdash;Yes&mdash;No,
not till to-night, nothing definite&mdash;we think&mdash;&mdash;” The
door swung to, cutting off the rest.</p>

<p>On the stone steps, they came face to face with a
little shrivelled man, head cocked to one side; Arthur
Heron, had they known it; rat about to rejoin the
sinking ship.</p>

<p>Out in the push and clamour of Holborn, Merle drew
a long breath, put both hands up to her hot face: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wonder if I shall ever grow cool again,” she said, rather
tremulously. And: “I suppose we’ve made rather
fools of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” gasped Peter. Every time she recalled
the blank look which had received her first eager speeches
it was as if someone had dealt her a blow in the face.
Oh, the stinging ignominy which lay in the remembrance
of Merle and herself, two blushing incoherent little&mdash;idiots,
intruding with froth and futility into the world
of real things, solid things, things that matter, world
of men. And Stuart could so easily have averted
humiliation from their heads: one look, one word, to
prove his recollection of the thousand intimacies that
had lain between them.&mdash;“A day in the country ...
I’m sorry&mdash;<em>Sorry!</em>” She ejaculated the word aloud
in accents of such furious scorn, that Merle looked
round startled. He should be sorrier still, soon! His
fault, every bit; not for ejecting them, but for ever
having dared invite them&mdash;to meet with that.</p>

<p>With a sense of rawness that cried out for solitude,
Peter suddenly bade Merle good-bye:</p>

<p>“I’m going home. Do you mind?”</p>

<p>And sorrowful for the mood of April so rudely shattered,
Merle shook her head and passed on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smaller">MERLE</span></h3>


<p>Thus Merle’s evening at Lancaster Gate was
doomed to be a solitary one. For Madame
des Essarts had sallied forth, in diamonds and
dignity, to a banquet celebrating the arrival in office of
a new Greek minister. The handsome old lady, with
her social talents, her knowledge of foreign languages,
her dainty pointed wit, the aura of martyrdom which
clung to her enforced exile from the hated Republic of
France&mdash;to which she could return whenever she pleased&mdash;was
of the type that had, in ruffled and beruffled days,
swayed kings and unmade ministers. Perhaps the secret
of her lost art lay in the fact that she never for one
moment forgot she was dealing with men, nor let them
forget that she regarded them as such, lords and puppets.
Not for Antoinette des Essarts the cheery comradeship,
the quick sexless sympathy, the contempt of cajolery
and intrigue, which distinguished the generation among
which she now moved. And perhaps from her had come
that ultra-feminine streak in Merle that expressed itself
in the girl’s attitude towards Stuart; something which
held out an involuntary hand for support, yet shrank, at
once disdainful and startled, from too rough-and-ready
an intimacy; even though, with Peter, she might rejoice
at what she deemed the whole-hearted freedom of the
trio.</p>

<p>In her soft gown of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-nil</i>&mdash;for who, argues
Madame des Essarts, who of the noblesse would appear
by evening light save in silk attire and satin slipper?&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dined in lonely state; seated at one end of vast
acres of dinner-table, with ever at her elbow a silent
personage bearing the chef’s latest inspiration. Peter
should by invitation have been keeping her company
this night, and making exceeding merry over the ceremonial
repast. And, it may be for the fiftieth time in
the past two years, Merle des Essarts breathed devout
thanks to the laughing young adventuress, who had
brought her from regarding as unalterable essentials
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-nil</i> and a French chef, Watteau and ambassadors,
all the incidentals of Merle’s quaintly formal setting, to
the point of view that these were mere delightful ingredients
in an ever-changing game of play; one costume,
vastly becoming indeed, among a million in
masquerade.</p>

<p>Yet to-night, lacking Peter, some of the old wistful
regrets touched Merle with chilly fingers; followed her
with ghostly trip into the little boudoir, grey and primrose,
Lancret looped medallion-wise into the overmantel;
whispered in lisping voices of a day that might possibly
come when Dresden, with ribboned crook for sceptre,
should again reign supreme in her life; pointed in light
mockery to a picture that adorned the wall: Merle
herself, aged eight, standing stiffly posed beside a sundial;
hands busy with the ivory sticks of a painted
fan; toes primly turned outwards; smooth, dark
curls; high-waisted pink frock. One moment fixed
indelibly to symbolize a whole childhood. And with
whatever passionate zest she might play now, Merle
knew, and hotly resented, that she could not make up
for her cheated years of château and convent, of solitude
and decorum and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il-ne-faut-pas</i>. To be sure, the latter
phrase did not need to be said often; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la petite</i> Merle
and her brother Fernand had been ever ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien sage lui;
et elle, un vrai petit ange</i>.’ Of course she had! Who
had taught her otherwise, before her twentieth birthday?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>... An April shower of rain swept the panes, glowing
sapphire-dark behind their primrose hangings. A
musical pattering shower, unreal as a lit boudoir and a
girl’s dreams....</p>



<p class="tbpara">&mdash;Crash! and an exquisite china clock lay shattered
on the ground. A thin little chap, with freckled impertinent
nose and pointed ears, looked up, startled, as
Merle hastened to the rescue: “Couldn’t help it; just
wanted to see how it took to pieces.”...</p>

<p>With wild hurrahs, a tangle of long legs and flying
skirts whizzed down the banisters and landed in a heap
at the foot.</p>

<p>Something delightful and sturdy, with dark red hair
and blown-out cheeks, was marching to and fro on the
polished drawing-room floor, waving flags and shouting....</p>

<p>Thus Merle drew from the Land of Corners, shadowy
corners of the old house, dim unswept corners in her
brain, dog-eared corners of forgotten picture-books, a
whole host of children; ordinary, healthy, grubby
youngsters, who would reduce the silent beautiful rooms
to their proper state of scrum and chaos. Above
all, naughty children; she collected the warm cosy
naughtinesses that has never been hers; gloated over
each separate deed of infamy; as if in offering to the
prim sad-eyed daintily clothed image on the wall.</p>

<p>... Dick was for ever robbing orchards and being
chased by irate farmers. But then how could he help it,
this eldest son of hers, just entering that close-cropped
hobnailed condition that betokens the schoolboy? And
Merle liked to see his rough bullet-head buried in her
lap, in moods of half-sullen contrition; would have
kept it permanently there, had Dick been willing.
Which he wasn’t.</p>

<p>... Nobody-loves-me came wandering in from the
garden. Nobody-loves-me was the ugly duckling, of
whom visitors were wont to say: “Never mind, my dear;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the Ugly Duckling grew to be a swan, you know,” a
prophecy which comforted the sufferer not a whit.
She was given to brooding, this particular infant; and
possessed, in addition, Bad Habits: Bad Habits, such as
Biting Her Nails. And, suddenly aware of the Bitten
Nails, Merle generously handed over Nobody-loves-me
to Peter, who lived next door, and who could therefore
be freely endowed with undesirable progeny, “because
anyway,” reflected Merle, “they couldn’t all be mine.”
And Dick and the Boy-girl, ringleaders both, kept her
hands pretty full. Boy-girl it was who erstwhile slid
the banisters; she, who climbed trees, and made
ladders in her stockings&mdash;such as no young lady should&mdash;and
blarneyed the cook; and once, by way of an
experiment, cut short not only her own mane of hair,
but also the straggly crop of Nobody-loves-me. The
incarnation of swift and mischievous daring, Boy-girl;
but who could be angry with her long, when she brought
her coaxing Irish charm to bear on the situation?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why Irish? Merle was not quite sure. She knew
only that it was, undeniably, Irish charm. And finally
solved the riddle by making the (shadowy) father of this
swarming brood, a son of Erin.</p>

<p>The little-mother-to-her-sisters-and-brothers, gentle,
smooth-haired and fond of her needle, to be found in
every well-regulated family, Merle, on consideration,
also presented as a free gift to Peter. Her own unacknowledged
favourite was the funny little beggar with
the puck-like ears, three-cornered nostrils set to catch the
rain, and scientific mind; which latter prompted him
invariably to take articles to pieces for the sake of seeing
how they worked. And they never worked again. There
were many, many costly rarities in the house, Merle
remembered happily, that literally asked for his attentions.</p>

<p>Or did she after all more tenderly incline to the
delicate child with clustering pale-gold hair? who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
nervously refused to sleep without a night-light; who
believed in fairies, and cherished all sorts of quaint
fanciful notions about the little angels&mdash;Merle pulled
herself up with a start, realizing that here she had in
wanton enjoyment created a veritable chee-ild! Unable
to slaughter in cold blood anything so lately born, she
compromised by ... giving it to Peter. For anyhow (in
guilty argument) Peter’s hair was of that peculiar pale-gold
tint, and what more natural than that her offspring
should inherit it?</p>

<p>Tumultuously alive now, all these ordinary healthy
grubby youngsters; making walls within and sky
without, resound with their whoops and coo-ees. A
turbulent out-of-hand crew&mdash;Merle is rather afraid she
is lacking in Proper Authority; in the balancing
whereof, she endows the (shadowy) father with a
“firm hand over the children,” in addition to his Irish
birth and other excellent qualities.</p>

<p>A few stray naughtinesses yet to be collected from
chimney-corner and rafter and cellar; such as leaving
all doors open,&mdash;except, in swift amendment, when
Dick rather chooses to bang them. Somebody, probably
the gardener, lodges a complaint that “they chairs
be rotted through again, left h’out all night in the
damp.” And Nurse says it isn’t her fault that the
young ladies and gentlemen won’t eat vegetables,
since they will persist in stuffing chocolate just before
their dinner; and Merle has much ado not to laugh,
knowing, via some subtle instinct, that every secret
opportunity is embraced to thrust tapioca, crusts, and
spinach into the crevice between walls and cupboard;
accumulated results only to be discovered at Spring-cleaning.</p>

<p>... Boy-girl dashes in to demand material for
“dressing-up”; already she has helped herself pretty
liberally; the polite request is an afterthought. The
nurseries overflow with messy pets&mdash;nor does Puck ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
remember to feed his guinea-pig. Nobody-loves-me has
run away, for the third time in a fortnight, because the
others don’t want her to play with them. His sailor-suit
very green and wet and messy from an afternoon’s
fishing in the pond, Copper-curls (his brothers call him
Carrots) stumbles into the boudoir, trailing behind him
tackle and weed and worm on the pale grey carpet.
Drowsily he cuddles his firm little body against Merle’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-nil</i>; slips a very hot hand between her cool
fingers; droops his mouth to the semblance of a celestial
choir-boy’s&mdash;so that she knows he has been very, very
wicked, and requires forgiveness and absolution.</p>

<p>And now Stuart is standing before her, eyes full of
trouble ... and the children tumble in quick confusion
back to the Land of Corners....</p>



<p class="tbpara">Bewildered, Merle rubbed her eyes: “I didn’t hear
you come in”; the door had been open, and the thick
velvet pile a muffler to approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>“Merle, am I going to be hurled from the battlements,
for failing to observe the divinity of play?”</p>

<p>She made no reply, not quite sure whether his mood
be not of mockery. And suddenly, with a quick and&mdash;for
him&mdash;rather clumsy movement, he dropped onto
his knees beside her chair, buried his head deep in her
lap; so that it almost seemed as if Dick ... Merle let
her fingers stray, half-fearfully, among the rebellion
of rough brown hair. For in the blur of twilight and
dreams and pattering rain, she could not as yet entirely
separate her phantom visitants from the real ones.</p>

<p>“Why, your coat is wet.” She bent forward to light
the gas-fire in the grate. And with a gulp and a leap,
the room was warm with a multitude of tiny blue
tongues, licking and panting through their skull-like
rings.</p>

<p>“I’ve been walking since five o’clock.” He was silent
for a moment. Then it came out, not in a grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
unburdening torrent, but in wrung jerky sentences, of
which the last caught up and contained the whole hidden
cause of pain:</p>

<p>“I was grown-up&mdash;didn’t hear the call ... and I
wasn’t even aware of it.”</p>

<p>Something wrong here which lay too deep for her
understanding. Merle asked no questions; content to
dry his coat; touch lingeringly his hair and shoulders;
give him the comfort she dimly felt he most needed.</p>

<p>“It didn’t matter, dear.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to shut me out, you and
Peter?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t do without you, Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” A tightness in his voice seemed to
have snapped at her tender assurance. His fingers,
which had gripped and twisted at hers till she could
have cried out with the pain, now slackened their pressure.
For the moment, the girl had succeeded in exorcising
the demons which were so strangely tormenting his
soul.</p>



<p class="tbpara">... A hush in the room. A hush so profound, that
two little figures stirred restlessly in their corner, came
tip-toeing hand-in-hand towards the door of the boudoir.
<span class="lock">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It’s no good,” whispered Nobody-loves-me, as she
tugged Puck backwards. “He’s still there.”...</p>



<p class="tbpara">Stuart looked up suddenly: “‘Wherefore to wait
my pleasure, I put my Spring aside....’ I always
knew it would be damnably easy&mdash;to slip beyond the
pattern and never get back....” The demons were
again at work within him. If only they would leave
him in peace, just for a moment, mind and body.</p>

<p>“Stuart, don’t you ever get tired?” she cried pitifully.</p>

<p>He muttered: “Dead tired,” and closing his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
allowed himself to relax entirely to her comforting
touch, the soft coolness of her presence; as if establishing
the memory of a second against which, in future
turmoil and stress, he might lay his cheek, and find
rest.</p>

<p>“Merle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear?”</p>

<p>He said nothing, but still pleaded; and bending down
her face to his, she found their lips clinging together.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Merle sat awhile, wondering how
much of what had passed must be told to Peter. Loyalty,
and the compact they had made: whatever happened,
to keep the path unblocked between them, demanded
an exact account of events. But that compact had
been formed in alliance against a hard and ruthless
Stuart of their imaginings. Her instincts were all to
protect the boy who had come to her in his trouble. He
had come to her&mdash;the thought was charged with sweetness.
And here she experienced a pang of pity for the
girl, the other girl, who looked like being the one left
out. But Peter’s anger at the morning’s episode had
been hot; she would not have known how to handle
him with the gloves his soreness demanded. Peter
didn’t like gloves.</p>

<p>... For an instant, Merle contemplated treachery.</p>

<p>No. It was popularly supposed that two girls couldn’t
be square with one another, where a man was in question.
Hers to disprove the theory. A secret unshared
by Peter would, moreover, be an insult to the spirit
of the trio; the first menace to its continued existence.
Merle hesitated no longer, but sat down at the escritoire,
and wrote her letter; a letter which omitted nothing,
not even the final embrace&mdash;though she winced at the
thought that Peter might possibly misconstrue it to
something more of man and woman, less of child. Then
she rang the bell and gave orders for the missive to be
taken at once to the post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>... Up the hushed staircase, and into the vast
shadowy bedroom. Had Stuart’s head really lain on
her lap? Or was he but one of the fantastic crowd who
had been abroad that night in Lancaster Gate; sliding
the banisters, playing hide-and-seek in the passages,
smashing the china&mdash;while the white-haired châtelaine
of the house took wine with the King of the Hellenes’
minister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smaller">PETER</span></h3>


<p>On reaching home, Stuart found Baldwin Carr
awaiting him in the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Hullo! you’re a late visitor.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d want to know,” said Baldwin,
from whose brow the unwonted lines of anxiety had
now been ironed away. “The whole business was a
fake&mdash;and Gobert has vanished off the face of the
earth.”</p>

<p>This was sensational. Stuart helped himself to a
whisky and soda.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by fake? the <span class="lock">envelope&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Empty, my boy. Blank bit of paper, that’s all.
Jove! you should have seen the faces when it was
opened. Old Rosenstein! Of course we smelt a rat,
and sent round to Monsieur Antoine’s apartments.
Not a sign of him. Left that morning, the landlady
said; bag, baggage&mdash;and incidentally, our fifty thousand.
Still, compared with what it might have cost us&mdash;well,
what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I take off my hat to Gobert,” replied the other,
with an amused chuckle; “fifty thou. isn’t too much
to pay for the privilege of acquaintance with the
swindler who can rob you of it.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;ah&mdash;I wouldn’t go so far as to say that.
Pour me out a stiff one, Stuart, I’m just about done
up. And then I must be off. Wanted to set your mind
at rest first. Where have you been all these hours?
Not that I blame you for bunking,”&mdash;Stuart smiled&mdash;“the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
strain was intolerable. I’d have escaped from the
office myself, only I thought it hardly fair to Derwent.”</p>

<p>Nor did his nephew seek to explain the real goad
which had driven him forth to pace the streets from
five o’clock that April afternoon.</p>

<p>Baldwin set down his glass: “Good night&mdash;&mdash;” he
paused. Something like emotion shook his voice.
“We’ve pulled through,” he said. And Stuart, knowing
the other was only recalled from adding: “we
Herons,” by a consideration of facts, composed his face
to lines befitting the occasion, and solemnly grasped
the extended hand. Baldwin’s pulling may have been
of a negative order, but of his pride in firm and family,
no man could remain in doubt.</p>

<p>Stuart fell asleep that night lulled by memory of a
sweet tremulous mouth, and dark eyes, deeply tender;
of a blur of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-nil</i> in a setting of pale primrose and
dim grey; of cool fingers quelling to peace all the hot
turbulence that tormented him; of a soft voice saying:
“We can’t do without you, Stuart....”</p>

<p>He awoke next day to the same memory, lashing him
with whips of shame. The deadly panic which had
resulted from his conduct of the preceding morning,
panic of clogging with moral and mental fat, his vision
of worlds beyond and his capacity for play, was as
nothing compared to the revolt with which he now
viewed his breakdown of the evening: the brimming
to the surface of weak sentiment, to find solace in a
girl’s caresses. Twice&mdash;twice in twelve hours to have
lost control of himself; to have taken his hand from
the tiller twice; to have twice resigned stage management
to an unseen power, which derided, even while it
swung him from “a sense of business responsibility”
to an extreme of maudlin hysteria. Stuart did not
spare himself in terms of abuse. And Merle had encouraged
him to make an exhibition of himself; Merle
had lent a sympathetic ear to his woes; asked no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
questions; flooded him with rosy forgiveness. Merle
had made it easy for him&mdash;easy and comfortable;
dried his coat.... Stuart smouldered and chafed,
seeing the incident pictured in bright colours: “A
Little Mother,” and framed on the nursery wall, valued
supplement to a Xmas number.</p>

<p>Why, in Heaven’s name, hadn’t she met him with
conflict of some sort; mockery that might have braced
him to action; instead of just allowing him to&mdash;slop.
Verb which to Stuart expressed the apex of abomination.</p>

<p>A sense of justice reasserted itself. Merle was
charming, no doubt of it; her response to his appeal a
very idyll of fragrance and simplicity. As for his curt
behaviour when the two girls had called on him in the
office, well, Stuart was hardly sorry any more; save
when the leprechaun recognized a glorious opportunity
missed: to have proved himself able to cope with both
situations in the appropriate spirit; with the light-hearted
“come out to play,” in the midst of the almost
unbearable tension consequent on the danger threatening
the affairs of Heron and Carr.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Couldn’t have devised it better myself,” mused
Stuart regretfully, as he gave Peter’s number to the
telephone clerk.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Peter sprang out of bed, hearing the postman’s
knock; and pattering barefoot downstairs, she drew
from the box, Merle’s letter, in company of an oblong
bill, and an envelope bearing St. Quentin’s by now
familiar handwriting. Then, returning to her room,
she seated herself on the edge of the bed; and, a pale-haired
gleaner in the early sunshine, proceeded to
examine her harvest.</p>

<p>The bill contained an intimation to the effect that
Mr. Lazarus, tailor, was amazed that Miss Kyndersley
should have ignored his repeated applications for payment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and could only suppose they had slipped her
memory, as otherwise doubtless, etc.</p>

<p>“I call that a delicate way of putting it,” reflected
Peter, with thoughts all of sunny kindness towards
Mr. Lazarus. “He’s trying to spare my feelings, bless
him. He shall have free tickets for dad’s next pier
concert.”</p>

<p>Of paying there could be no question. Peter, true
to the traditions of her caste, never settled her debts
till actually threatened by the law; when she would
hastily sell her silver hair-brushes, or borrow from her
aunt, or pledge the half-of-her-next-year-but-one income;
diminutive amount at best, inherited from her dead
mother. She also had what she called her “submerged”
periods, when by dint of forswearing the world
for an entire fortnight, and working hard eight hours a
day at colouring art postcards, she scraped together a
sufficient sum to extricate her for a short while from
the perpetual webs with which finance encumbered her
pathway. Never yet had she been altogether free from
pecuniary embarrassments; would indeed have missed
the background of their mutterings, as those who have
dwelt long by the sea cannot bear to be deprived of its
eternal swish.</p>

<p>Mark St. Quentin, striving to mingle in equal proportions
formality with infatuation, begged leave to visit
her at Thatch Lane the following Sunday. Peter
dimpled mischievously; she would wear a white dress,
and playfully beg him to help lay the knives and forks
for supper: “We have only one servant, you see; and
treat you as quite one of the family”&mdash;and she dimpled
again at the thought of Stuart’s disgust on anyone
treating him as one of any family, anywhere.</p>

<p>Stuart ... a slight contraction of her bare toes, as
she remembered how the said gentleman had incurred
her displeasure. She wondered what his attitude was
likely to be. Then opened Merle’s letter&mdash;and found out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter raised her head; gazed straight through the
window, across garden and hedge and field, to where
the Weald hunched its back against the sky. But her
eyes missed the tender greens and misty blues of the
landscape; could not share in the joy of the house on
discovering it at last owned, after five gloomy months,
a clear black shadow to lay upon the dew-wet grass.</p>

<p>For she was wondering how not to be jealous.</p>

<p>It was not the incident itself which rankled; but
recognition of a fact that long ago had carried its
conviction, though only now its results: Merle was
allowed, by the unseen code, to be the more feminine of
the twain. She, Peter, thrust willy-nilly into the bolder,
more challenging position. Was it that she was born
with a tilt to her soul, as well as to her nose and chin?
She could not tell. But Stuart, gravitating to her for
all stimulation, had nevertheless gone to Merle for
comfort. And Peter wondered furthermore why she
played up so persistently to the Laughing-Cavalier
qualities, with which from the very first he had chosen
to endow her. And, wondering, knew yet that she must
continue boyish and defiant; though she, even as Merle,
wanted how much to be tender to him in his present
attire of sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>The getting-up gong sounded, and Peter returned to
bed.</p>

<p>The breakfast-gong, half an hour later, led her to the
bathroom; and another quite irrelevant gong saw her
wrestling with stockings. Only when the gongs finally
ceased from troubling, did she descend to the dining-room,
there to find Aunt Esther deeply immersed in
the “Daily Camera.”</p>

<p>“Peter, just look at these!”</p>

<p>‘These’ were startling pictorial presentments of
Antoine Gobert, the notorious diamond wizard; flanked
on the one side by Sir Fergus Macpherson, looking like
a Jew, which he wasn’t; on the other, by an elderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and speckled Stuart: “youngest partner in the firm of
Heron &amp; Carr.” Below appeared sensational accounts
of the shameful fraud which had been practised, and
the scene which took place in a private room of the
Bank of England, at 6.30 p.m. of the previous day,
when the bubble was pricked.</p>

<p>Peter’s lip curled as she read. So that accounted for
Stuart’s sudden mood of contrition. Easy enough to
find time for being sorry, after the cause of anxiety had
been removed. It required no Stuart Heron for that.
Nor did she consider that the strain adequately accounted
for his preoccupation of the morning. According
to his own standards, he should be strung up to
response at any moment, however inopportune. If he
could be exacting, why, so also could she. Quite cured
of her yearnings towards womanly tenderness, she
tossed aside the paper, and helped herself to eggs and
bacon.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” quoth Miss Esther, “I always say that
foreigners aren’t to be trusted; and I’m sure it’s very
nice and pleasant to think young Mr. Heron isn’t going
to be a bankrupt after all. Of course he has rather
more money than he knows what to do with; but
still, it’s better in the hands of a gentleman than a
rogue. And these things will get in the papers, and
there you are! What can you expect? However,
there’s no harm done; the Bank of England is too
wide-awake for that. And,” an after-thought, “Heaven
will punish the swindler, I’ve no doubt.”</p>

<p>Thus having, according to custom, neatly packed
away the entire set of events within her own private
and particular boundaries; reduced each participant,
including Heaven and the Bank of England, to a height
convenient for patting on the head, Miss Esther Worthing
asked for the marmalade.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang. Peter dashed up the stairs,
prepared to spurn still further into the dust the bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and prostrate figure at the other end of the wire.
Stuart’s cheery greeting, however, did not quite coincide
with her expectations.</p>

<p>“Hullo! That you, Peter ... dear?” almost a sub-current
of amusement in his tone. “What’s the
attitude?”</p>

<p>“Bellicose,” was the spirited retort.</p>

<p>“Thought so. It would have been so much less
obvious on your part, to have held out the hand of
forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“You want a Briareus of forgiveness, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Oh. So you’ve heard from Merle.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Silence for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the fact that of my own accord I regained
the sense of things&mdash;or rather the nonsense of things,
doesn’t it all absolve me from your wrath?” still that
slight mocking inflection. Peter thought how pleasant
it would be to hurt him. Hurt him quite badly.</p>

<p>“Of your own accord?” she flung indignantly into
the mouthpiece. “Why, I’ve seen the papers. Naturally,
<em>after</em> your business troubles were so unexpectedly
smoothed out, you had leisure to turn your attention to&mdash;minor
matters.”</p>

<p>“As it happened,”&mdash;she could not complain now of
too light a note in the icy incision of his speech, “I did
not know that the Gobert thunderbolt had been averted,
until I reached home after seeing Merle.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t know?”</p>

<p>“I did not know.”</p>

<p>“The envelope was opened towards half-past six,
according to the Press.”</p>

<p>“I believe that’s correct.”</p>

<p>“And Merle writes that you turned up about nine
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“To be exact, a quarter to nine.”</p>

<p>“And yet you knew nothing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“And yet I knew nothing.”</p>

<p>Their speeches followed each other with the thud and
rebound of a swift rally over the tennis-net.</p>

<p>“The evidence is against you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not on my defence. I merely state facts.”</p>

<p>Peter said very gently: “Do you expect me to
believe them?”</p>

<p>“You will&mdash;later. At present you are merely laying
yourself open to the unpleasant necessity of apologizing.”</p>

<p>“Apologizing?” she cried, hotly resenting this turning
of the tables. “For what?”</p>

<p>“For calling me a liar.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t use the word.”</p>

<p>“Then use it&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar, Stuart.”</p>

<p>She was unable to tell if his evident anger were
assumed or genuine. But, if the latter, so much the
better; she anticipated a pleasurable excitement from the
unexplored territory beyond the limits of his tolerance.</p>

<p>He was speaking again. And Peter wished he would
free his voice from its straining bonds of control.</p>

<p>“Quite right. I am a liar. A very plausible and
rather dangerous liar. But, quite by accident, in the
present instance I happen to be speaking the truth.
When you’ve recovered from your attitude of scepticism,
ring me up. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Peter went for a walk. She walked hard for a couple
of hours; avoided the plunging soil of pasture-land, in
favour of hard country roads, where her feet met with
a ringing resistance. On reaching a village, six miles
distant from Thatch Lane, she entered without hesitation
the local post-office.</p>

<p>... “Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Stuart.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I discard my attitude.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“From weakness?”</p>

<p>“No. From conviction.”</p>

<p>“Good. Thank you.”</p>

<p>She rang off.</p>



<p class="tbpara">In this wise, the trio forfeited their first fine carelessness.
Disintegration was imminent, though none
could tell as yet which way it would manifest itself.
Each of their words and actions, however trivial, took
on a certain significance. For Stuart had heard in Peter’s
voice the battle-ring, and tingled to its challenge. For
Peter had known an instant’s jealousy of Merle. For
Merle had battled with the temptation to be disloyal
towards Peter. For Stuart had twice in a day ceased to
be master of his moods, and vowed by all his gods these
moods should neither recur again. For Merle cherished
the second of them as a memory sweeter than music.
For Merle had been visited by an old ghost, and by a
merry host of new ones. For Peter had definitely flung
her cloak, tossed her plume, donned the disguise which
Stuart mistook for nature. For all these follies and
cross-follies are the outcome of certain fatal desires to
go a-maying on a day of April!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">STUART GOES A-STUNTING</span></h3>


<p>The girls knew that Stuart’s next act would be
a carefully veiled apology to the spirit of the
trio, for the moment he had been deaf to its
call. Apology that would probably manifest itself in
a deed of unwonted daring, originality and impudence,
that none might suspect it of being an apology; deed
which would firmly re-establish in the eyes of the twain
his slightly shaken position. For though with Peter
he had crossed swords in single combat, had known the
pleasure of knocking from her grasp the weapon, the
pleasure of stepping back to allow her to resume it,&mdash;not,
most certainly, because he was a little gentleman,
but because he preferred her blade in hand; for though
with Merle he had walked awhile in a two-world too
softly cushioned for his taste; yet with these things the
spirit of the trio did not concern itself. Nor was it to
be placated save by offering to the number three. So
Peter and Merle were somewhat surprised when Stuart’s
expected fireworks tamely resolved themselves into a
verbally conveyed invitation to spend the first week in
May with his elder sister, married to an owner of vast
estates in Devonshire.</p>

<p>“The orchards will all be in bloom, and ought to look
rather fine,” said Stuart; “by the way, did I mention
that I’m invited as well? We can paint the place as red
as we please; Dorothy and Ralph won’t interfere with
us much. Dorothy wanted to know if she need write to
you both separately, but I said it would be all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dorothy&mdash;Ralph&mdash;Devonshire,” echoed Merle, when
she was alone with Peter; “what a picture it conveys
of flowered chintz and cream and low window-seats.
I’m sure the tenants call her Mistress Dorothy, and she
has calm grey eyes, and wears a fichu, and keys.”</p>

<p>“Rather an inadequate costume,” Peter murmured;
“and I can’t imagine a sister of Stuart with ‘calm’
anything. Shall we accept? My country boots are
done for.”</p>

<p>“Buy new ones.”</p>

<p>“New ones always take weeks to tame. I’d rather
tame a bull than boots. The Bull and Boot sounds like
a public-house. I wish Stuart hadn’t taught me to
search for the hidden pub. in my most innocent phrases.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather a low habit,” Merle agreed. “Yes, I
think we’ll visit Mistress Dorothy in Devon, if Grandmaman
has no objections.”</p>

<p>Grandmaman had no objections whatever, though
the invitation came somewhat too informally for her
notions of etiquette. She was also at a loss how Merle
was to make adequate return to her hostess, and
insisted on the girl packing the gift of a three-tiered
satin bonbonnière among her evening frocks, by way
of a beginning in the balancing of ledgers.</p>

<p>Peter bought her boots; gladdened Miss Esther’s
county soul by an entirely fabulous narrative relating to
the ancient birth and lineage of Squire Ralph Orson of
Orson Manor; and on the fifth of May, met her two
fellow-travellers at Paddington. Stuart established her
with Merle in a first-class carriage, with every possible
luxury; for in detail-work he excelled, never allowing
their schemes to be upset by a single hitch of the
mechanical order. Then, to their astonishment, he
begged leave to retire to a smoker.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we looking our best?” Peter demanded of
Merle, as the train quitted the platform, and the belt of
his Norfolk coat vanished down the corridor. “Or is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he trying to impress us with the fact that for the future
he intends to Lead a Man’s Life?”</p>

<p>They saw nothing of him during the next few hours,
not even in the luncheon-car. And towards three
o’clock Peter declared they must be within that distance
of Dawlish, the station for Orson Manor, when respectable
people with rugs would begin strapping them:</p>

<p>“Not having any rugs, we’ll compromise by washing
our faces.”</p>

<p>Merle leant out of the window, and took a deep breath
of the sparkling air.</p>

<p>“Stuart didn’t say it was near the sea,” as the train
ran alongside the broken silver line of wave. “Why,
this <em>is</em> Dawlish! Peter, here we are&mdash;<span class="lock">we&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>The engine gathered all its slumbering forces, and
thundered at the speed of a mile a minute through the
tiny station in its setting of bold red rock.</p>

<p>“It&mdash;hasn’t&mdash;stopped,” gasped Merle. Which was
obvious, seeing that her slight figure against the window
was flung from side to side by the reckless pace at which
the express was pounding through Devon.</p>

<p>And: “Stuart, it hasn’t stopped!” as that gentleman,
with a pleasant smile, and still carrying his pipe,
entered their compartment and sat down.</p>

<p>“No; this is the ‘Cornishman.’ It goes right
through from Plymouth to Penzance.”</p>

<p>“But your sister?”</p>

<p>“My sister is in bed with influenza. And anyway,
she’s not expecting you. I doubt if she knows of your
existence.”</p>

<p>He rose, and surveyed with a ferocious scowl his
bewildered victims.</p>

<p>“I’ve abducted you!” quoth Stuart. “I’ve told
you often enough that I was a pirate in disguise. You
wouldn’t believe me. You played with fire. Now
you’re abducted without the option of a fine. Open
your mouths and scream, if you like; I don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter eyed him sternly: “You mean that the
invitation was a hoax? You lured us from our homes
on false pretences?”</p>

<p>He was humming a tune from the “Pirates of Penzance,”
and at the same time polishing his eye-glass.
So he merely nodded assent.</p>

<p>Merle said quietly: “This will mean an awful row
for me.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t,” he reassured her; “because nobody
need ever know. To all intents and purposes we’re
staying at Orson Manor. Dorothy only comes to town
about once every four years, and I’ll tip her the wink
to play up. She’ll do it for me,” finished the lord of the
house of Heron.</p>

<p>“But where are we going?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the remotest notion. We’ll see when we
get to Penzance. And I’ll let you both have a say
in the matter, though it isn’t usual in cases of abduction.”</p>

<p>He stole a glance at Peter; her eyes were dancing,
and the corners of her mouth tilted upwards. So that
he knew he had pleased her. Though she merely said:
“So that’s why you refused to travel in our company,
is it?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stand your innocent chatter about
Dorothy and Devon,” he confessed; “it’s weak, I own,
but even a pirate has a heart that bleeds for prattling
babes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but look here: suppose Madame des Essarts
and Mrs. Heron should come together. Your mother
will know that we are not where we seem. They do
meet, don’t they, Merle?”</p>

<p>Merle took fright at the notion. “Not often; they’re
in different sets. Grandmaman moves mainly among
consuls, you know. But they visit on At Home days.
Oh, <span class="lock">Stuart&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“D’you take me for a bloomin’ amateur?” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
demanded, “Haven’t I provided for every contingency?
I sat me down and thought and thought
and thought what one lady could be made to do, to
mortally offend another. I repeat, to mortally offend
another. All for the prevention of visits on At Home
days. At last, I uprose, and put myrrh and frankincense
upon my hair, and went unto my mother; and,
‘Mother dear,’ I said, soft as any cooing dove; ‘I can
see you are harassed and beset. Would you like me to
make out the list for your big reception next month?’
Fortunately, I’ve played the good son once or twice
before, so my conduct couldn’t arouse the suspicions it
deserved. Nay, she was touched almost to the point of
tears. So I sat me down again at her desk, with lots of
ceremonial and fuss&mdash;address-books heaped all round,
a new ruler, and red ink, and a Bradshaw and Debrett
and the telephone book; and made out a list of visitors,
omitting the name of Madame des Essarts. Mark you
this, Merle! Then I read the list aloud to my mother,
including the name of Madame des Essarts. Mark you
this also, Merle! Then my mother, well-pleased, handed
to her private secretary the list, minus the name of
Madame des Essarts. And Madame des Essarts, not
receiving an invitation to the reception, will be mortally
offended. And my mother, receiving no reply from
Madame des Essarts, will likewise be mortally offended.
Both mortally offended. The feud will probably extend
over generations. Montague and Capulet. In consequence
whereof, Merle and I will be forbidden to marry.
And I’ll die for the love of a lady. ‘Lady, heyday,
misery me&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Stuart,” Peter broke in upon his exuberant ditty,
“you’re just nothing but a stage-manager. You’re not
the sort of man for vagabondage. And your grand
operatic abduction will be a failure. Recollect, you
wouldn’t come with us a-Maying in April.”</p>

<p>“No,” he cried, stung to swift retort; “but who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
dares say that I have not made of you April fools
in May!”</p>

<p>The train swung over the Hamoaze and into Cornwall.</p>



<p class="tbpara">They stopped at the Land’s End, for the reason that
the sea barred their further progress to the south and
to the west. And they took three rooms at the Ocean
Hotel, facing the sea to the south and to the west,
because it was too late the night of their arrival to seek
convenient caves, especially three caves of exactly the
same dimensions, conditions essential to avoid jealousy
and strife.</p>

<p>The Ocean Hotel stood on an isolation of headland,
like some stone medieval fortress, frowning at the
rocky imitation opposite, which ran far out into the
Atlantic, and then piled itself up crag upon crag, an
echo wrought in granite. Over the moors towards the
sunset ran the coastguard’s path, white stones on the dark
green, sheer up to an edge, lost in the drop on the further
side. And over the moors towards the sunrise ran still
the coastguard’s path, down an easy slope, looping a
sinister crevasse, and as far as the stretching horizon line.</p>

<p>Peter awoke the next morning, possessed by a great
lust for actual touch of the sea, where she had hitherto
only enjoyed its sight and sound; and would hardly
leave her companions time to wallow in the tubs of
yellow cream which were a feature of their breakfast,
in her impatience to run down the steep twisting path
which she knew existed somewhere just outside....</p>

<p>But the land of Cornwall and the waves of Cornwall
were not ready yet to be friends with the strangers;
and all that day led them a mocking dance by crag and
outjutting cape and promontory; over moor and
round seven points, and never a downward way to the
sea. Cast an evil spell upon the strangers, so that ever
from two hundred feet below, the water beckoned them
stealthily into cavernous velvet glooms; sang loudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of wonder and glory in the cold crash of breakers
against the cliff; tormented them with glint of blue in
its plum-darkness, hint of glittering green whenever the
clouds above swirled aside to reveal patches of clear sky.
For the strangers need not yet be shown what riot of
colours were sheathed in scabbard of sullen grey. Peter
could have dragged the elusive sun by main force into
prominence, battered with fists of rage against the
uncompromising fall of rock which baffled her, and
mocked her, and drew her on with continual promise of
a way to the sea round the next curve ... or perhaps
the next ... or surely the next....</p>

<p>Stuart laughed at her impatience. It was a hard
land, a good land; and he knew it, and did not talk
about it, but was content to swing along over turf and
bog and stone; aware of limitless space in which to
tire his limbs. And once he came racing like a greyhound,
past his comrades, towards a six-barred gate
which lay ahead. Ran because his stride was swifter
than any man’s. Leapt the gate because his jump was
cleaner than any man’s. Then, without a run on the
further side, vaulted back, and met the twain with a
cry of “Mountebank!” in anticipation of how they
would greet his prowess.</p>

<p>But under his amused self-condemnation, lay the
disturbing knowledge that this desire to exhibit his
utmost strength and skill was real, not assumed; desire
born of the look of pleasure that, after each feat, would
lurk in Peter’s eyes, though her lips continued to mock
his vanity. Stuart could have shaken her for this effect
on him. He did not mind at all behaving childishly,
but objected vehemently to thinking childishly.</p>

<p>Peter perched herself upon the gate; and airily told
the sea that it was all a mistake, she had no desire
whatever to reach it. And the sea in response threw out
a sparkle of gold and a spurt of foam, so that the longing
rose in her heart fiercer than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a gate padlocked and bolted, though it led to
nowhere, and guarded nothing; and to the right and
left of it lay open country; and to the immediate right
and left, piled-up blocks of rough stone, for kindly
assistance of those who would elude the padlocks. A
mad gate in a mad country. And now the sun, thinking
it had teased enough, broke in a pale dazzle on the grey
land and sea; then, gaining strength, poured silver
streams of light through a rent in the sky, lay in silver
puddles and splashes on the water. The dark toneless
granite piled itself into strange shapes of tower and
turret, and all about the sea-birds wheeled and shrieked.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... “Magic casements, opening on the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>murmured Stuart, prone beside Merle upon the turf.
And she whispered back:</p>

<p>“One could almost persuade oneself&mdash;yes, look,
Stuart! a face at those jagged rock-windows&mdash;light
flying hair and haunted eyes and ... it’s gone when
you look again.”</p>

<p>“That’s Lyonnesse, yonder.” Peter, from her seat
on the topmost bar, indicated the wide shimmering
tracts of grey and silver. “The sunken lands, you
know. Cities and churches and meadows ... but
they must have suffered some sea-change ... white
bones and thick green water and the evil coil of seaweed.
A dead land, now.”</p>

<p>Stuart said musingly: “I see Lyonnesse more as the
land where the dead wait till they are wanted again.”</p>

<p>Peter smiled; so like Stuart, this glimpse of an afterwards
as merely the rest which comes before a fresh
bout of strenuous labour. Then couldn’t he even
conceive of complete and utter rest? “Where the
dead wait till they are wanted again” ... she caught
a fleeting glimpse of dim caverns, and a tiny figure
stumbling in from the outside glare, and flinging down
a torch, seized instantly by an upward-springing form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
who bore it forth again; while the tired intruder
stretched himself in sleep....</p>

<p>Heigh-ho! how serious they all were. Peter looked
around her, half-dazed by this long mental immersion
in dark coral-caves. The sky had meanwhile deepened
into blue, and all the buried colours of earth and water
had leapt into being.</p>

<p>“Requires a dab of red in all that backcloth of green
and black, doesn’t it?” queried Peter idly; to break
silence; “just for the sake of artistic effect.”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Oh, say against that ledge.” She pointed half-way
down an apparently inaccessible formation of cliff,
jutting out at right angles to the land.</p>

<p>Stuart seized the scarlet cap from her head, before
she was even aware of his intentions, and was almost
directly over the edge of safety, and out of sight.</p>

<p>“Stuntorian!” murmured Peter ... but her hand
dug deep into the turf, tore it up in great handfuls.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before they again caught
sight of him, scrambling with all the agility appertaining
to impossible schoolboy heroes, towards the spot
indicated. His figure was reduced by distance and
surroundings to absurdly small dimensions. He paused
on reaching his goal, hung the patch of crimson on to
the ledge of rock, waved gaily towards his far-off companions;
then, cramming the cap again in his pocket,
swung himself round a boulder apparently poised in
mid-air, and out of their line of vision.</p>

<p>“We’d better turn back to meet him,” quoth Merle,
springing from her perch on the gate. “It’s all right,
Peter. Nothing can happen to Stuart, ever.”</p>

<p>But Peter had just learnt of something extremely
disturbing which had happened to herself. And venting
her indignation at the discovery, upon the cause thereof,
refused to fall sobbing upon his neck, when he met them
on the homeward way, and carelessly returned her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
headgear. Nor did she take outward and visible notice
of bleeding abrasions upon either knee, ostentatiously
displayed. But Merle&mdash;feeling his recent performance
ought really not to be encouraged&mdash;treated him to a
sober lecture on foolhardiness, which lasted till Peter
provided distraction by leaving her right leg, as far as
the thigh, in a bog of black mud.</p>

<p>The sun was a level blaze of gold in their eyes, by the
time they trudged up the last slope, and into their
fortress. They were weary with a splendid weariness of
limb; and drowsy with the strangeness of that strange
land; and, moreover, wind-blown and wet and satiated
of beauty. Peter entered her room, and closed the
door; pulled down the blind to give respite from the
outside world; plunged her hands in water, and cast
off her shoes and stockings. Then flung herself on the
narrow bed, where Merle presently joined her. And
they ate of the expensive chocolates destined for
Mistress Dorothy Orson, and were at peace.</p>

<p>... Somebody whistling, now loudly, now softly,
up and down the passages and stairs. “Yo-ho!
Yo-ho!”&mdash;it was Captain Hook’s celebrated ditty
haunting the Ocean Hotel. Nearing their door, it
paused on a plaintive up-note of enquiry. Peter took
pity on the homeless wanderer, and before Merle could
protest, called him in.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ve got an apartment of my own,”
said Stuart, squatting contentedly on the floor, his head
against Merle’s dark shower of loosened hair. “I slept
somewhere, I suppose, but where is a mystery. They
must have turned my room into a step-ladder or a
revolving book-case; I shall hate sleeping to-night in
a revolving book-case; one would get so giddy.” He
glanced around him and broke into a chuckle: “What
a setting for one of Zola’s most squalid bits of realism,”
he remarked.</p>

<p>The room was small, with a dingy paper, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
unclothed gas-jet springing from the wall. The blind
that shut out daylight, and dimmed the corners to
mystery, was torn, and the cord flapped a perpetual
complaint. The tin basin on the washstand stood
unemptied of its dirty water. Two or three towels lay
across the chairs; Peter’s muddy shoes and stockings
straggled in abandoned fashion over the worn bits of
carpet covering the oilcloth. The aspect of the two
huddled bare-legged figures on the crumpled bed-spread,
carried out Stuart’s simile with remarkable fidelity;
and his own presence, combined with the dainty satin
bonbonnière, added just those last touches of immorality
without which no French novel is complete.
Only their moods of serene happiness were rather at
variance with the puppets of fiction, evil or perhaps
merely hopeless, with which Zola might have peopled the
dreary chamber.</p>

<p>“I think, as pirates, and considering Merle lives in
Lancaster Gate and owns a maid, we deserve a better
nursery than this,” suggested Peter.</p>

<p>“We’ll build one,” Stuart assured her swiftly. “Yes,
of course we will. Nothing easier. We’ll build it to suit
ourselves. A p<span class="lock">layroom&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“A piratical <span class="lock">playroom&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“The perfect piratical playroom.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">A PERFECT PIRATICAL PLAYROOM</span></h3>


<p>Stuart began: “We shan’t care to be disturbed,
so we’d better build under water. That
stretch of river between Cliveden and Cookham
would make quite a good ceiling. Nor will we take it
on a repairing lease, but leave the Thames Conservancy
responsible for damages.”</p>

<p>Merle at this juncture wanted to know how he saw
the Thames Conservancy; in her eyes, it wore very
bright blue with lots of gilt buttons, and was always
sitting round a table.</p>

<p>“One person?” asked Peter curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. One wide person that could be stretched all
round the table and be joined with a button when it
met itself.”</p>

<p>Stuart reminded them that, so far, the room consisted
of a ceiling floating on a vacuum, and that if they
dawdled so long over Thames Conservancies, they’d
never get the walls up before dinner.</p>

<p>“It’s my dinner-hour now,” said Peter, thinking
herself a British workman. And Merle remarked that
putting up walls was a tough job, and she hadn’t got
the right tools, and must fetch her mate.</p>

<p>“We can’t tell yet just how big the Room will need
to be, so I vote for elastic-sided walls.”</p>

<p>“Like boots,” Peter murmured. Then roused herself
to ask for the height of the Room.</p>

<p>Stuart looked worried, and confessed that he could
never gauge heights without the assistance of a giraffe:
“Not high heights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“A giraffe?”</p>

<p>“I was once told that a giraffe measures twenty-five
feet. So in my mind’s eye I always pile giraffe upon
giraffe, until I get what I want. One giraffe, added to
another ... and another....”</p>

<p>“There, there then, my beautiful,” Peter assured
him soothingly, for the multiplicity of giraffe had caused
a wild look to creep into his eyes; “you shall have a
giraffe in the Room, of course you shall. Anyhow,
Merle will want a domestic animal to cuddle on her lap.
A giraffe will do nicely, besides being useful for measuring
purposes.”</p>

<p>“We can tell the time by it, as well,” Stuart announced
in eager defence of his pet. “The tide of the ceiling
rises and falls about an inch every six hours; and when
it falls, the animal’s head will be wet, and so he’ll always
have a cold in his nose, and borrow all our handkerchiefs,
and not return them. He says he can’t help it;
people don’t realize what a struggle it is to keep one’s
head below water.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll want a companion of some sort,” remarked
Merle. And because she secretly hoped for a canary,
she proposed a tortoise.</p>

<p>“What about a gift-horse? There’s something
mysterious about a gift-horse, because nobody may
look it in the mouth. No, not even a dentist.”</p>

<p>“But we will!” Stuart cried, in defiance of copy-book
precept; “we’ll keep things in its mouth, for the
sake of looking at them there; cigarette-cards and
photograph albums.”</p>

<p>... A little wind flapped aside the blind, giving a
momentary glimpse of sea-lapped rocks and battlements:
a castle of enchantment aglow in the ebbing
light. Merle immediately decided to have it transported
to the Room, for her special use and benefit.
Not to be outdone, Stuart and Peter ordered each a
castle of like design and pattern; he stipulating, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
for a border of Norfolk Broads in lieu of the Atlantic.
And because his manner was wont to become suddenly
absent and remote whenever he chanced to speak of
his Sailing Paradise, they quickly granted him his desire,
and changed the subject, lest he should elude them
altogether.</p>

<p>Indeed, Peter was in a terrible tangle; for she had
discovered that inside her castle was a room&mdash;<em>the</em> Room,
in fact; and this Room in its turn held a castle, the
same castle&mdash;which held another Room, containing a
castle, <span class="lock">which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Look here,” said Stuart firmly, recalling his mind
from halyard and jib, “this must be attended to at
once. It’s only a recurring decimal, and if we quickly
put in the dot to stop the leakage, there’s no need that
it should ever recur.”</p>

<p>Peter demanded carelessly: “Know anything about
plumbing?”</p>

<p>Stuart scratched his head. And the girls looked
mournfully one at the other.</p>

<p>“Now I ask you, what is the use of a male in the
house?” and: “If it were a <em>real</em> man, of <span class="lock">course&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Damn it!” he exploded. “If you’d wanted to
marry a plumber, both of you, you might have mentioned
it before the ceremony.” And he added sarcastically:
“I daresay St. Quentin knows a lot about
plumbing.”</p>

<p>“Or Baldwin,” suggested Merle, who had recently
met Mr. Carr at a dinner-party, and derived from him a
quantity of pure happiness.</p>

<p>Stuart recovered his good-humour in the joy of a
fresh idea: “We’ll run St. Quentin and Baldwin together,
and keep the essence in a sentry-box in the Room, for
the performing of odd jobs. And we’ll call him&mdash;”
here a rapid hunt for suitable nomenclature, “we’ll call
him Squeith.”</p>

<p>“Combination of St. Quentin and Keith,” com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>mented
Peter. “Very good if Baldwin’s name happened
to be Keith, but as it isn’<span class="lock">t&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I’m not going to be put off by a little thing like
that. Squeith has got personality. Squeith pleases
me. And Squeith shall immediately be set to work on
that recurring decimal.”</p>

<p>It was perceived that even while they chattered,
Room and castle had already recurred seven times,
ending on a Room. And Peter said she would sleep in
the last Room but one&mdash;the fifth, to be exact,&mdash;before
the dot was put in.</p>

<p>“And then Squeith can take the animals for a run,”
quoth thoughtful little Merle, who remembered that
giraffes and gift-horses require a certain amount of
exercise. “He can put them on a leash if he likes.”</p>

<p>Stuart grumbled: “He’s sure to come home without
them. Or they’ll come home without him. Yes, it’s
no good frowning at me, Merle,&mdash;I <em>will</em> bully Squeith.
You’d better have your Balm-for-Wounded-Feelings
factory moved into the Room; ‘Nothing but the Best
Balm supplied. Beware of Counterfeit. We only use
British Bull’s-grease and Home-grown Sympathy.’ I’ll
write your advertisements.”</p>

<p>Whereat Peter exclaimed jealously that if Merle had
a factory, she would have trains; she must have trains,
instantly&mdash;“just as if I could ever live in a Room without
trains. An Outer Circle line running the whole way
round, close under the walls; with real tunnels and
signal-boxes. And you can advertise your Balm inside
the darkest tunnel, where it won’t disturb the landscape.
My railway shall start from Euston, of <span class="lock">course&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>&mdash;“And end at Euston,” Merle reminded her, laughing,
“if it’s a Circle railway.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. The lines shall be laid for the purpose
of taking passengers from Euston to Euston. I’ve
always longed for just such a gloriously unpractical
service of trains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>And here Stuart interposed with the offer of his almost
forgotten <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Wagon-lit</i>, the tame red <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Wagon-lit</i> with
trustful brown eyes, hitherto kept in the back garden
among the washing.</p>

<p>“Want a present too,” Merle pleaded.</p>

<p>He gave her a clothes-line, so that she could be
perpetually wringing out her soul, and hanging it up
to dry. In return for which piece of impertinence, she
presented him with a nice easy rack, which he could
work himself, like a barrel-organ, by turning a handle;
and thus practise for half an hour every morning after
breakfast, the self-torture he so affected.</p>

<p>“He shall have an obstacle race as well,” put in
Peter lavishly; “running just inside my Outer Circle
radius. With hurdles and barriers and sacks and barbed
wire. You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Stuart darling?”</p>

<p>“We should have to provide a barber to barb the
wire. One can’t buy it barbed.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I don’t mind a few shops. Just a barber
and&mdash;and a post-office, because of bull’s-<span class="lock">eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Stamps?” enquired Stuart anxiously.</p>

<p>“No. <em>Only</em> bull’s-eyes. Why do you think I wanted a
post-office?”</p>

<p>Merle thought that a Moonshade Shop might be useful:
“It looks as if the moonshine in the Room were
likely to be strong, and Peter and I must think of our
complexions. Moonshades and paralunes.” And she
imagined them pretty filmy things, woven of dyed
spider-webs, with opalescent handles and spikes.</p>

<p>Then they added to the row, a Railway Shop, which,
combining butcher and baker and fishmonger in one,
provided those peculiar comestibles to be met with at
station-buffets and in dining-cars alone. In particular,
there existed the notorious Railway-fish, white and
sticky, of which large numbers should swim in a sunken
tank in the Railway Shop, till such time as required for
consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as if one shop bred another, it was discovered
that these wary fish could not be caught save with a
bent pin on a piece of string; thus involving the erection
of a Bent-pin Shop.</p>

<p>“Because in the usual farthing-change packets, they
only give you straight pins,” said Peter, knitting her
brows; “and straight pins aren’t a bit of good for
Railway-fish.”</p>

<p>“What about a pub. or two?” Stuart proposed carelessly.</p>

<p>Merle scented danger: “No, dear.”</p>

<p>“Just one,” he pleaded; “a nice little public-house
bearing the sign: Private. There’s the ‘Cat and Adage,’
been lying about since the evening we first met, Peter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if it comes to that,” she bragged, “I’ve got
plenty of pubs myself: The ‘Benison,’ for instance,
inspired by A. C. Benson’s life of Tennyson. That
would be non-alcoholic, of course; with a permanent
impression in the window, of birds dark against a peaceful
sunset.”</p>

<p>Stuart approved of the ‘Benison.’ “I like its
nice rich ripe blessing-of-the-Archbishop-of-Canterbury
flavour. And Squeith can patronize it for his morning
glass of milk-and-soda. I’ve thought of another
<span class="lock">one&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“<em>No</em>, Stuart!” Merle threw into her voice all the
pent-up anguish of an inebriate’s wife.</p>

<p>Stuart and Peter looked rebellious.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to have my nice tidy Room littered
up with pubs.” Merle declared passionately. “You
must keep them in the conservatory or the lumber-closet.
I shall have quite enough dusting on my hands, as it is,
what with three <span class="lock">castles&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“One of them recurring,” put in Peter.</p>

<p>“Yes, and two Eustons and the giraffe and a Norfolk
Broad and a sentry-box and I don’t know what else.
Whatever I shall do on <span class="lock">Thursdays&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thursdays?”</p>

<p>“Thursdays?”</p>

<p>“The day the Room gets turned out,” Merle enlightened
their double ignorance.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“It seems rather a shame that Merle should be
bothered with all that,” Stuart mused thoughtfully.
“What about having a property Womanly-Woman to
see to the dusting?”</p>

<p>Peter assented rather reluctantly; she was quite
sure that the Womanly-woman would make her wear
gloves. “Oh well! if she became at all obstreperous,
we could always break her up, and re-form her as something
else. An Ancient Retainer, say; or a Rabbit.
These Plasticine figures are awfully useful.”</p>

<p>“There’d be a bit of Womanly-Woman over from a
Rabbit; enough to make a tea-spoon, or a halo, or any
domestic trifle of that description.”</p>

<p>“Then are we to have no real human people in the
Room, except just ourselves?” Merle queried. “No&mdash;children?”</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head. “No children. Only childishness.”
For he recognized, deep down in his heart, that
real children would stigmatize the Room and all it
contained, as “silly rot.” And demand bricks and
Noah’s Arks and Tiddley-winks. And somehow the
knowledge hurt; because he knew with what fatal ease
he too could slide outside and say the same: “Silly
rot&mdash;silly rot&mdash;&mdash;” “It isn’t! Rot, if you like&mdash;not
<em>silly</em> rot!”... but even now he was slipping.... “It
isn’t! it isn’t&mdash;Peter....”</p>

<p>Peter guessed what was happening: “No, of course
it isn’t,” quickly. And to divert him, contributed to
the Room a sailing-boat, a rustic sailing-boat, stationary,
and overgrown with ivy and clematis. And from the
stern should depend a tiny toy sailing-boat, price sixpence
halfpenny, which they could really sail on a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of string. “And we’ll name it the ‘Strike-me-pink,’”
cried Peter fiercely.</p>

<p>“And paint it green,” added Stuart, feeling better.
And then, in opposition, he offered a nautical summer-house,
with decks, and ropes, and a burgee fluttering
bravely from the mainmast.</p>

<p>The Room might by now be considered almost complete
in its furnishings. With a Heaven-born inspiration, Merle
placed in its exact centre a small bamboo table, rather
rickety, on which reposed a vase of flowers.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” Peter demanded doubtfully,
“that it looks a wee bit out of place among all those
castles and animals and things?”</p>

<p>“Not at all;” Merle was inclined to be huffy.
“Merely the feminine touch about the home;” and she
considered the possibility of draping Euston with an
antimacassar.</p>



<p class="tbpara">... Bit by bit, as the red ball of the sun quenched
its fires in the chill Atlantic, so the dingy little number
nine bedroom of the Ocean Hotel, grew darker and
darker still. At last nothing could be descried save the
grey outlines of the tin basin; a glimmer across the
cracked looking-glass; on and around the bed, three
figures, dimly sprawling.</p>



<p class="tbpara">But in their own Playroom, the trio disport themselves
as lords and emperors. Boundless space is theirs;
time without limit; while facts they prick and shrivel
like toy-balloons.</p>

<p>Peter, astride of the engine which draws her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">wagon-lit</i>,
is whizzing round and round the Outer Circle, all
the signals in her favour, that naught shall arrest her
triumphant speed.</p>

<p>Merle, discovering that Stuart has, after all, succeeded
in importing his private public-house, enters through
its swing-doors, nothing loth to demand a strawberry-ice-cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
soda. The while Stuart dangles his legs from
the notched parapet of his castle; and noting Squeith
in the act of hailing the bell-buoy who sells the morning
muffins, impishly frustrates all such traffic by a sudden
alteration of the time to half-past five p.m.</p>

<p>“Tea is on the table,” he chants, a super-leprechaun;
“and Squeith has missed the muffin-man again! Poor
Squeith! for him <em>always</em> the muffin that is stale; for
him it is always yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And for us?” cries Peter, making a trumpet of her
hands, as she travels past at sixty miles an hour. And
just catches his shouted reply, wind-borne: “For us it
is always to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“But it can’t be to-morrow without a to-day, can
it?” argues Merle, returning refreshed from the ‘Benison.’</p>

<p>“Why, yes; it can be the-day-after-to-morrow from
yesterday!”</p>



<p class="tbpara">... The housemaid tapped, and entered with the
hot water.</p>

<p>“Shall I light the gas, Miss?”</p>

<p>“Yes, please;” Peter’s voice seemed to come from
very far away.</p>

<p>While the housemaid hunted for the matches, a figure
rose nonchalantly from the floor, and stole out into the
passage. So that the flare of light revealed merely two
sleepy-eyed girls lying across the bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smaller">CARN TREWOOFA</span></h3>


<p>Stuart solved the riddle which lay in the personality
of Mine Host, by declaring that whereas in
summer he followed the fair and guileless calling
of hotel-keeper, in winter a bolder voice summoned him
forth, and he threw off his disguises, and donned ear-rings,
and became a Corsair. And indeed there was
that about him of jolly rakish raffish swagger, a roll in
his gait, and a ruddiness of visage, and withal a disposition
to solemn winking of the left eye, and a tendency
to be found in odd moments dancing strange dances the
length of his own hall, which gave to such a suggestion
a flavour of likelihood.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Corsair had surrounded himself by a
bewildering bevy of females, whom he called variously
his wife, his cousin, his housekeeper, his secretary, and
his manageress; but who were obviously delicious
yieldings of his six-months’ piracy.</p>

<p>But the Ocean Hotel could produce no equally satisfactory
solution to the problem of Merle, Peter, and
Stuart; and the various possibilities in the way of
marital, sentimental, immoral, or blood relationship,
that their companionship entailed. Perceiving this,
Stuart found gentle delight in preserving strict impartiality
in the bestowal of his outward affections.
The Spanish waiter at the Billet-doux would have
known much in common with the Five Females of the
Ocean Hotel. A climax was reached, when, under their
assembled eyes, Peter entered the breakfast-room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
handed a tobacco-pouch to her lord and master, reminding
him in bell-like tones that he had left it in her room.
Whereat a shudder passed from guest to guest, and a
horrified voice remarked with more virtue than grammar,
“Guessed it was her&mdash;I mean, one can always tell!”</p>

<p>Then enter Merle with a book and a box of matches
and a green felt slipper: “You must have left them in
my room, Stuart ...” and Stuart affected great embarrassment,&mdash;and
they were all three very happy and
contented.</p>

<p>But when the visitors at the hotel complained of
people who go from table to table before meals; deliberately
and in the sight of all, pouring cream from
smaller vessels into one gigantic bowl, thereafter placed
upon their own table; then the Five Females did so
persistently harass and beset the Corsair, that he
became quite melancholy, and would sit all day long in
the porch, gazing seawards, without even the heart to
nudge Peter in the ribs as she passed him by; a delicate
attention she sorely missed. For he liked the trio,
perhaps recognizing in them the germs of piracy, and
was loth to give them notice to quit.</p>

<p>“You know, I really believe we shall be slung out
before to-morrow,” laughed Stuart; “we’re not a bit
popular.” They were at that moment topping for the
first time the westward slope of moor. Not yet had
they succeeded in finding their path to the sea. Peter
had almost despaired of feeling the cool water swell and
ebb about her ankles.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, they saw Carn Trewoofa.</p>

<p>Carn Trewoofa lay tucked in a little cove, the green
arm of the cliff flung protectingly around it, as who
should say: “All right, dear; the nasty grim granite-land
shan’t touch you then!” And the toy fishing-village
believed this, and was at peace, drowsy and
tumbled in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>A toy fishing-village. Patched roofs; thatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
roofs; roofs both patched and thatched; wild and
abandoned young roofs, seemingly kept only in their
places by heavy chains or great slabs of stone. Sturdy,
ugly stone walls, defying the winds, that, despite protective
arm, dealt sometimes roughly with toy villages.
Dwellings of all shapes and sizes, impartial dwellings for
lobster or fowl or human. Round windlass-tower,
painted a startling white, presumably with what was
left over from the coastguard stones. Wood and slate
and tar. Overturned boats and baskets. Nets hung
to dry; smocks dangling to dry; dogs and children
spread to dry; and on a rough bench outside the lifeboat
shed, a row of old salts, bearded and tough and
stringy, and beyond the utmost limits of dryness, so
that the sun could do to them no more.</p>

<p>A toy village, no doubt! The kind that one has
longed to play with, ever since first meeting it in picture
book. Nor did it beguile with false whispers, as had
done the rest of the false land of Cornwall. For the
coastguard’s path ran straight down the cliff-side to
the very doors of the first fowl-house; and the rocks
and pools of the Atlantic trespassed so far into the heart
of the village, that it was difficult to disentangle them.
A way to the sea at last.... Merle and Peter ran
shouting down and on and out, the length of a baby
stone lug that curved into the water, thinking in its
infant delusion, that it broke the force of the waves.
And there, at the very furthest end, they turned and
surveyed Carn Trewoofa, spread in a glimmer of gold
before them. And they remarked the multitude of
boats strewn drunkenly on the cobbled slope from the
shore to the first cluster of huts; remarked the fleet of
boats that rocked and swung on the vivid green of the
bay; green that beyond the lug deepened and glowed
to shadowed ultramarine. And they received a hint
that somewhere was an inn; and somewhere else the
twisted fragments of an ancient wreck; and all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were seagulls, swooping and balancing and shrieking.
And well-pleased with this latest and most complete
piece of nursery-ware designed for their happiness, they
turned their gaze outwards, there to be met by a rust-red
sail passing swift as a dream over the broken white
wave-crests; while a mile nearer to the horizon, a
quaint clockwork lighthouse reared itself from a group
of rocks, and made believe to guard the bay.</p>

<p>Then Merle rubbed her eyes, and turned to Peter,
and asked if it were really all to be had for the price of
two-and-eleven-pence-halfpenny? and might she please
carry it home herself?</p>

<p>Stuart joined them on the lug. “They can’t yarn,”
he said regretfully, jerking his thumb towards the line
of ancient salts. “I’ve tried them and they can’t. In
fact, I believe they’re tin.”</p>

<p>“Detachable?” queried Peter.</p>

<p>“No; on a row. I daresay it would be possible to
break one off from the end. But they’re too old and
glazed to be taught much; we must start with the new
generation, and teach the young idea how to salt.
Perhaps if we sowed among them a few volumes of
W. W. Jacobs&mdash;I say, come along and explore.”</p>

<p>They entered Carn Trewoofa softly, as if fearful it
should break or melt or in some such magical fashion
manifest its unreality. And, picking her way between
rope and anchor and occasionally a stray doorstep
where there was no door, Merle came to a correct conclusion
regarding the origin of this wonder-corner: It
was smell made concrete. Someone had waved a wand
over a handful of the richly mingled prevailing odour
of seaweed and sea, tar and fish and clover, straw and
fowl, soil and stone and lobster-pot; muttered a few
compelling words&mdash;and the result was Carn Trewoofa.</p>

<p>The trio were just able to add to their medley of
impressions, the mad swirl of paths, seven to one hut,
that none could tell its back nor yet its front; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
yet madder swirl of chickens, seventy to one hen, and
seven orphans to boot. Every ten yards traversed
showed them a painted slab set in the wall, or in a door,
or even on a roof; a slab and a slit and the word:
Letters. They speculated what would happen if somebody
failed to realize that this was a toy village, and
posted real epistles in these alluring receptacles. “They
are intended for all the letters one has never sent,”
Stuart declared; “letters to my own feet, or to my
great-uncle in Heaven; to the Times, and to a skylark,
and to the Red King in Looking-glass Land.”</p>

<p>Likewise he discovered the national fisheress costume
to be a cricket-cap; and counted no less than eight of
these articles in the wearing. “Which proves that
once, many years ago, a cricket team rounded the point
in a pleasure steamer. And the Corsair lured them all
to their destruction. But their caps were washed up on
the shore, and worn ever since by the Women of Carn
Trewoofa.&mdash;Nine! I’ll stalk the lot e’er yet I quit this
spot.” He counted the tenth on the head of a buxom
matron standing outside the “Longships” inn, and
doing most effective things with two buckets and a pump.</p>

<p>She nodded pleasantly to the three, and asked them in
raucous Cornish whether they were strangers in the land.</p>

<p>“Very,” responded Peter gloomily.</p>

<p>The wearer of the tenth cricket cap volunteered the
information that she had rooms to let.</p>

<p>“At the inn!” gasped Merle.</p>

<p>“Nay; up-along yon villa. T’inn be nowt fur t’
young leddies.”</p>

<p>Smilingly she indicated a grey stone cottage standing
high on its own steps, a few paces up the hill; its blind
patient eyes looking steadily across the bay, past the
toy fishing-fleet, to where sea and sky merged in a blue
quivering haze.</p>

<p>They followed their guide into the tiny sitting-room of
the “villa.” And there Peter cast herself with a sigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of voluptuous content upon a slippery slithery horsehair
sofa; and Merle threw open the lid of a wheezy
harmonium&mdash;and broke it; and Stuart remained transfixed
before two black ivory elephants, which stood upon
the mantelpiece. And they each and all declared their
intention of remaining in their new quarters, never
again to return to the disapproving atmosphere of the
Ocean Hotel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenner beamed. They did not realize then that
her rosy good-humour concealed the will of a Napoleon.
For Mrs. Trenner was the autocrat of Carn Trewoofa;
its leader and counsellor; by virtue of her unfailing
prosperity and the excellence of her cooking. She owned
the inn, and property besides; and she owned her
husband and son and husband’s brother’s wife and
their offspring, even as she now owned Merle and Peter
and Stuart. The sons and husbands of other women
might drown at sea; not so Mrs. Trenner’s. The
chickens of other women might cross the road and be
run over on the occasion of the fortnightly visit of the
butcher’s cart; never Mrs. Trenner’s chickens. Therefore
she wore her cricket-cap jauntily. On her indeed
had fallen some of the radiance of that Star of Good
Fortune under whose mellow auspices Stuart had been
born. She and Stuart became, in consequence, excellent
friends, though the language they spoke was mutually
uncanny and perplexing.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to budge from here,” quoth Peter
again. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’y suis et j’y reste.</i> Isn’t that so, Mrs.
Trenner?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenner hesitated: “Well, theere t’es,” she
ejaculated at last; her favourite expression in moments
of emergency.</p>

<p>Peter continued: “Merle shall go upstairs and feel
the beds, and see if the mattress is clay soil, or whatever
has to be done under those circs. And Stuart can return
to the hotel and pack our suit-cases.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuart demurred. He might cope with the Corsair,
he said, were it not for the Five Females. So they all
returned to the hotel, telling Mrs. Trenner to have their
dinner on the table that very evening. And they said
this in all innocence, knowing nothing of the dinner, nor
of what lay before them.</p>

<p>Before quitting Carn Trewoofa, Merle dashed through
the tiny doorway marked “Mrs. Nanvorrow, Grocer,”
just to see what lay hidden in its murky depths. She
returned with a pennyworth of peardrops, and a fearsome
account of an old ancient crone sitting in the
kitchen, surrounded on floor, ceiling and walls, by
china; a frenzied orgy of china; a veritable Bacchanal
of china; china that sprouted and multiplied and
literally asked for the destroying bull. “She squawked
at me like a parrot,” Merle related in awestruck whispers,
“and called me ‘dearie.’” She paused impressively.
They were trudging up the cliff-path towards the
Coastguard Station.</p>

<p>&mdash;“And I’ve discovered the eleventh cap. It was on
the Witch’s head.”</p>

<p>Then Stuart sat down, and reproached her bitterly.
He didn’t want any of the caps now, he said, if he
couldn’t be left to find them himself. And anyway,
stalking cricket-caps was a man’s job, in the pursuance
of which, he considered Merle both unladylike and
officious. “It isn’t as if I were childish about things,”
concluded Stuart.</p>

<p>Then he looked Peter full in the eyes; and she laughed
aloud at his utter childishness, knowing of the man
beneath; knowing he knew she was by now aware of it.
And Merle laughed with her, unconscious as yet that
two of the three were playing games no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Are ye all reet?” demanded Mrs. Trenner, hovering
round their three chairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a feast of Lucullus,” sighed Peter, eating fresh
young crab.</p>

<p>And Stuart, over an oozing pasty, declared that Mrs.
Trenner must be a reincarnation of the cook primarily
responsible for Epicurean philosophy.</p>

<p>“Well, theere t’es!” but Mrs. Trenner was obviously
not satisfied. Then, nibbling at a saffron cake, Merle
said gently, in words of one syllable: “The best I have
yet ate, Mrs. Trenner.” And, wreathed in smiles, their
landlady departed to the kitchen, there to retail to
Maid Bessy, the one comprehensible bit of praise.</p>

<p>“Best she yet ate&mdash;thet’s what her said tu me,
t’little leddy....”</p>

<p>“I foresee,” quoth Stuart, “that we shall have to
leave to Merle the hectic chorus of praise which must
inevitably accompany all our meals. Mrs. Trenner
doesn’t appreciate our classic mode of expression, Peter.”</p>

<p>Peter moaned: “It’s awful; she gives us five times
too much, and seems to take personal pride in our
appetites. I daren’t leave a morsel. There’s something
chubbily relentless about that woman. However,
thank goodness there can be nothing more to come
now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trenner entered; in one hand a plate of cheese-straws
wherewith to break the camel’s back; in the
other a bottle of Pond’s Extract.</p>

<p>“Are ye all reet?” she demanded, placing these
upon the table. The three gazed, worried, at the
Pond’s Extract. Was it local fashion to consume this
with their cheese-straws?</p>

<p>“Mis’ Gurton, she thet hev t’ big room faacin’ this,
she sent it over, thinkin’ ee might hev tired feet o’
nights, after walkin’,” volunteered Mis’ Gurton’s
messenger. Then, hovering uncertainly awhile, in the
difficulty of removing herself through the door, without
assistant impetus, Mrs. Trenner shot forth: “Well,
theere t’es”&mdash;and vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Evidently,” mused Peter, “one leaves Pond’s
Extract in lieu of cards, up-along tu Carn Trewoofa.
I suppose we are bound by etiquette to return toothpaste
or Dinneford’s Magnesia upon Mis’ Gurton.
They seem inclined to be friendly here.”</p>

<p>Outside the little square of window, the sky-colour
was fast being drained and sucked into the West; and
over the line of moor, a pale lemon-coloured moon
wound and unwound herself like a dancer amidst trailing
wisps of cloud, lilac and tender pink. Swaying rhythmically
from the fading glow of day to the lifeless pallor of
evening, the little dark fleet of fishing-boats could be
glimpsed in the bay.</p>

<p>Indeed, Carn Trewoofa was inclined to be friendly
with the strangers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;Stuart leapt the low wall, and made a dash for a
group of sheds huddled in the farmhouse yard.</p>

<p>“Come along!” he cried; and helter-skelter, through
the icy sting of rain, they followed his lead.</p>

<p>... Something enormous hurled itself impotently
against the wooden door, as they slammed it behind
them.</p>

<p>“It’s a pig. I saw it,” gasped Peter. Her hand
fumbled for the latch, could not find it; small wonder,
since it existed on the further side of the door. The
latter opened inwards. Peter leant against it the full
weight of her body: “Help! it’s big and black and
bulging&mdash;and it’s coming in!”</p>

<p>“Let it,” quoth Stuart indifferently. “Who are we,
to object to a respectable old sow?”</p>

<p>But Merle, sitting exhausted in the trough, avowed
a firm refusal to share this harbour of refuge with aught
whatsoever in the pork line. So Stuart took Peter’s
place at the door; and she sank into the trough beside
Merle, and through the dim light watched with breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>less
interest the fierce encounter between man and
beast, divided only by a thin partition of wood. Again
and yet again did the ungainly monster hurl its quivering
bulk to the assault, till the insecure building rocked
and shook. Disgusted snortings and gruntings mingled
pleasantly with the lash of the rain, and the distant
chime of church-bells from Carn Trewoofa, six miles to
the south from this clump of moorland huts and farms.</p>

<p>“My&mdash;sympathies&mdash;are all&mdash;with&mdash;the&mdash;pig,” jerked
out Stuart, holding his own against terrific odds.
“After all, it <em>is</em> her sty. An English pig’s sty is her
castle.”</p>

<p>Chorus of indignant assent from the pig.</p>

<p>And then Merle was suddenly seized by an uncontrollable
fit of laughter.</p>

<p>“Peter, it’s Sunday afternoon, first Sunday in the
month; and our At Home day at Lancaster Gate.
Did your little granddaughter’s frock come from
Paris, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chère Madame? mais tout à fait charmante</i>.”</p>

<p>The pig rallied for yet a final onslaught. This time
she was just able to inject a bristling snout....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Merle liked to feel that she was ‘making friends with
the rustics.’ Nevertheless, sitting abreast of the low
sea-wall, she looked somewhat astonished at the
bearded veteran who slouched to her side; and, pointing
to a picturesque abode covered by a round roof of mud,
announced fiercely, and without any preamble, that it
was to be razed to the ground, after he and his had
dwelt therein for close on four hundred years.</p>

<p>“Taaken from me an’ destroyed, next Monday week.
Iss. An’ me without a hoam tu put my foot in et.”</p>

<p>“There’s no place like home for putting one’s foot in
it,” murmured Peter, in the background, to Stuart.</p>

<p>Merle heeded them not; she was busy sympathizing
with the ‘peasant heart of England.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fur why?” demanded the man, brandishing his
stick. “Fur nowt. Bit o’ rain pourin’ through roof an’
in our beds. Mud isna slate.”</p>

<p>“No, no, indeed,” cooed Merle. (“Do be quiet,
Peter.”)</p>

<p>The veteran swung round, and indicated a timid-looking
damsel standing a few yards off: “Yon’s my
daughter. Yon’s t’ girl as gets fits.” His tone rang
with such pride, that Stuart stepped forward and
congratulated him heartily.</p>

<p>“How very sad for the poor girl,” Merle raised
hyacinth wells of sympathy to the weather-beaten face
above hers. (“Stuart!”)</p>

<p>“Eh, thet’s t’lass. She du get them moastly in
chapel, she du.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” brightly, “then wouldn’t it be better if she
never went to chapel?”</p>

<p>A gurgle of laughter from Peter. Merle turned her back
yet more squarely upon her irrepressible companions.</p>

<p>“Ne’er can tell when she be gettin’ one o’ they fits.
Scream, she du, an’ fling up her arms.” He regarded
his talented offspring intently. “Seem tu me, she be
gettin’ thet way now....”</p>

<p>Merle fled.</p>

<p>“Never mind, then,” Stuart teased her half an hour
later. “She <em>shall</em> be remembered in the hearts of the
people. She shall understand the simple joys and
sorrows of the rude <span class="lock">peasantry&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“After all,” Peter finished consolingly, “you’re the
only one of us who can make Mrs. Trenner understand
what pudding we want for lunch.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Merle cried, casting herself upon their beloved horsehair
sofa:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a day! I’ve never been so happy&mdash;and
never so gloriously disgracefully untidy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Peter and Stuart looked long upon her, and
looked at each other and smiled. For despite her
delusions to the contrary, Merle’s vaunted ‘untidiness’
merely succeeded in fitting her to her present frame, as
surely as the central figure of a Cornish Riviera poster;
a daintily clad mermaid was she, pale-faced and lissom,
with eyes reflecting the stormier tints of the sea;
delicate ankles; blue-green jersey, closely blown to the
figure; hair waving in long strands, albeit not wispily,
about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Merle’s appearance,” remarked Stuart, “is of the
very few that can be trusted to look after itself for hours
together. Now Peter’s physiognomy needs careful
attention every five minutes; it burns and flushes and
freckles; and her hair gets really untidy, not merely
picturesquely ruffled; and her cap falls to the back of
her head, and the buttons are off her skirt, and her neck
is mottled mahogany, and oh, her jersey! how sagged
and dragged and bagged it <span class="lock">was&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“But then, how it was cheap,” finished Peter.</p>

<p>“When are you two girls going home?” suddenly.
“I’m off at to-morrow’s dawn. The call of diamonds.
You’d better fix another day; we don’t want to look
back on a long journey together, and a sulky, sooty
arrival in London, as an ending to all this that we have
had. It would be ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“O thou of the Hairpin Vision!” but Peter understood
his mood. “When do we want to go, Merle?”</p>

<p>“Saturday is my birthday, and grandmaman is
giving me a dinner-party of all the people I hate most.
We may as well leave on Friday morning. It’s Wednesday
to-day, isn’t it?” vaguely.</p>

<p>“Tuesday. By the way, what have you done about
your letters home? Postmarks, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Carn Trewoofa is the nearest postal town to Orson
Manor in Devonshire,” replied Merle. And Stuart sat
down beside her on the sofa, and discoursed pleasantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
on the lake of fire and brimstone, till Mrs. Trenner
appeared to introduce them to their lunch, in its raw
and natural condition. After which, she retired to
cook it. Even Carn Trewoofa is no stranger to certain
conditions of etiquette.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... So they all three squatted upon the outermost
rock, and waited to be Caught by the Tide.</p>

<p>Sitting thus, bare-legged, knees hunched up to the
chin, hands clasped about the knees, eyes solemn with
expectation, they might have served for an illustration
to some children’s tale of adventure. Peter wore a
floppy crimson cap on her pale tangle of hair. Merle’s
two heavy black plaits hung uncrowned. They did not
speak; only gazed outwards, to desolate seas beyond
the seas that have an end; and waited ... patiently.
The lapping of water was the only sound. A wee crab,
a green crab, waddled crookedly forth to examine with
interest the thirty toes dangling into his private pool.</p>

<p>A south-westerly breeze blew upon their tanned
throats ... and the light began to ebb.</p>

<p>Seven days now had they tarried in Carn Trewoofa,
and had not yet succeeded in being Caught by the
Tide. Therefore shame was upon them.</p>

<p>For the waves of Cornwall said: “If we surround
them, they will merely elude us. And if they elude us,
they will regard our strength and our cunning as mere
attributes in a game of play invented by themselves.
They are not as others, these strangers in the land. So
we will not be beguiled into an attempt to drown them.
They shall return to their homes without the supreme
wonder and glory of being Caught by the Tide.”</p>

<p>Thus the Waves of Cornwall.</p>

<p>... And when they had been fully nineteen minutes
on the outermost rock of all, waiting ... patiently ...
Peter said in a very small voice: “Do you think, oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
do you think, it can be because the tide is going
out?”</p>

<p>Stuart replied: “Peter, Peter, I didn’t like to say so
before, but I am afraid it is indeed because the tide is
going out.”</p>

<p>“If we were now in France, we would be Caught by
the Tide.”</p>

<p>“But we are in Cornwall.”</p>

<p>... And sorrowfully they rose, and picked their
way over the slippery boulders, towards the beckoning
grey cottage that stood high on its own steps, a few
paces up the hill.</p>

<p>The little south-westerly breeze was gaining in
strength.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little south-westerly breeze had become a south-westerly
gale. It blew a great restlessness into Stuart
that evening, so that he walked ceaselessly from window
to door of the cottage, and at last suggested going forth
to meet the elements squarely, and without the intervention
of stone or glass.</p>

<p>Merle was drowsy from much scrambling, said she
preferred to remain peacefully within.</p>

<p>“Come along, Peter.”</p>

<p>And from a lazy desire likewise to refuse the battle,
the other girl quickened to something in his tones;
without a word, threw on a heavy cloak; and, bare-headed,
followed him through the village, and up the
coastguard’s path to the crest of the cliff.</p>

<p>Here the wind caught them; not erratically, nor in
gasping squally fashion, but a massed wall of wind,
blowing steadily, straight and hard from across the sea,
with never a swell nor yet a drop in the strength and
sound of it. A mighty cleansing wind, causing every
muscle and nerve of the body to be braced in resistance,
without a second of rest or relaxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>From far below, echoed the cold crash of breakers on
the rocks. Far above, torn battalions of cloud swirled
witlessly across a shuddering moon. Along the cliff,
white splashes that marked by day the coastguard’s
path, now came and went like evil staring faces....</p>

<p>Stuart swung on, unfaltering; Peter followed as best
she might. Once she stumbled. He stopped, and flung
a guiding arm about her.</p>

<p>“I can walk alone,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“I know you can....” The tempest hurled his
voice straight past her, and across the black stretch of
moor. “And it’s because you can walk alone, that
you’re going to walk with me now.”</p>

<p>They pressed forward, eluding carefully what they
thought was bog-land, only to discover on looking back,
that they had been tricked by shadows. And shadows,
again, resolved themselves into marsh-patches, yielding
and treacherous. A fine rain sprayed their coats to a
glitter. The moon had been beaten from her fields,
leaving the world in a roar of darkness.... Once
they halted abruptly on the verge of nothing, where the
land had been eaten away. Once they followed the cliff
that ran out sheer to a point, crested by dark shapes of
granite, monsters thrown up æons ago by the waves.</p>

<p>Peter and Stuart stood motionless for several
moments, rigid bodies thrusting at the wall of wind,
that blew with never a drop nor yet a swell in the
strength and sound of it; stripped from them all
memory of a narrower stuffier world.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Tired?”</p>

<p>“Of the wind?”</p>

<p>“Of me, then?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never yet met the man who could tire me.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>With a laugh, he turned, strode back to the mainland.
Then, facing suddenly round, met her scrambling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
down from the granite. Met her, and put his arms about
her&mdash;this time neither in support nor in guidance, but
fiercely, and because of the thing that had lain crouching
between them, now storm-whipped to sudden life. Her
short hair beat and stung against his face. Their lips
were stiff and crusted with salt. It was not a night for
words. Once he spoke her name....</p>



<p class="tbpara">Later, swinging down the homeward path, they came
upon sight of Carn Trewoofa, three or four stray lights
splashing the darkness. It was good to know that one
of these was from Merle’s lamp. Good to imagine her
sitting in the battered arm-chair by the window, thinking
of the other two in the turmoil outside.</p>

<p>Good to be the two in the turmoil outside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smaller">TWO&mdash;AND ONE OVER</span></h3>


<p>Stuart’s departure meant for Peter and Merle
a period of twoness deliciously free from the
tension of extreme demand which he made upon
their minds and bodies alike. Mentally and physically,
they allowed themselves now to flop; excluding long
tramps and dangerous climbs; mooching for the most
part in and about the village, or among the shallower
rocks; hardly talking; secure in the friendship that
took much for granted.</p>

<p>The morning before Carn Trewoofa was to see the
last of them, they awoke to a drenching downpour,
which beat sea and moor and sky to one sodden colourless
pulp. All day long the rain descended sullenly;
and towards evening Merle coaxed Mrs. Trenner to
transfer live fire, leaping and flaming on a shovel, from
her kitchen to their sitting-room grate. Then she and
Peter drew up their arm-chairs, definitely abandoned
all idea of making an effort, and allowed themselves to
be lulled to that half-hypnotic state of coma produced
by warmth within and rain without; hush unbroken
save by the muffled boom of unseen breakers on the beach.</p>

<p>“Good thing he’s gone,” murmured Merle; “Stuart
hasn’t got a fire-light mood.”</p>

<p>“How d’you know?”</p>

<p>“Instinct.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” Peter conceded; “he can
find pleasure in the rest he earns by utter exhaustion;
none in just volupping.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good word.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Peter, and proceeded to volupp, eyes
half-closed, arms hanging over the side of the chair;
too luxuriously lazy even to rise for a cigarette.</p>

<p>Dusk and the rain joined hands beyond the streaming
squares of window. The moving world was very far
away from Carn Trewoofa in its greyness. From the
kitchen, two voices rose and fell in sing-song fashion;
not seeming to belong to Mrs. Trenner or Bessy or any
human shape; merely voices, monotonous, ceaseless,
chanting.</p>

<p>Merle had since several minutes been watching Peter
intently. All of a sudden she cried: “Don’t!”</p>

<p>The other girl roused herself from reverie: “Don’t
what?”</p>

<p>“That sleepy-tiger look of yours. I hate it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It’s so&mdash;replete.”</p>

<p>Peter laughed. “Perhaps it has been fed and wants
exercise.”</p>

<p>“On a lead? Up and down the Park for twenty
minutes every day? Oh, Peter, why haven’t I too got
a tiger to sit beside yours on the wall?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sit on a wall,” retorted Peter, who was
inclined to take her tiger seriously.</p>

<p>“Darling, you know it’s only a Nestlé’s-Milk
Advertisement Cat. The fat creamy one. We’ll call it
a tiger, if you like. It’s a very fine cat.”</p>

<p>Peter picked up the pair of sand-shoes which Stuart
had left a-sprawl on the fender; and musingly fingered
the torn soles: “Millionaire’s footgear,” she murmured
scornfully; certainly they were in a disgracefully
tattered condition. She pulled the two elephants from
the mantelpiece, and laid one at rest in either shoe....
“Elephant cradles....”</p>

<p>“Are you talking in your sleep?” queried Merle.</p>

<p>“I was pondering the matter of Cheap Sentiment,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
lied Peter. “I’ve got whole Marshes of Cheap Sentiment
in my being, which I dare not show, nor even
countenance, but which are unmistakably spreading.”</p>

<p>Merle snuggled deeper into her arm-chair, and cooed
encouragement: “Go on, Peter!”</p>

<p>“Just think,” gently rocking the elephant cradles,
“if I admitted Stuart to my passion for curly-haired
small infants; told him that carols sung on frosty
nights bring a lump to my throat; or that organ music
makes me want to be good. Yes, it does, Merle&mdash;honest
injun! And I like stroking somebody’s hair in the
firelight, and simply ache at times for the strong
shoulder to lean <span class="lock">on&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Try Stuart’s,” suggested Merle unkindly. And
Peter shuddered.</p>

<p>“Shoulders! he’s got ridges; they’d cut like a
knife; and what isn’t ridge is knobs. No, I meant the
sort of shoulder, with that traditional Harris-tweed
scent ‘that ever afterwards brought his image with
such cruel distinctness before her mental vision.’ You
understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour qui prenez-vous moi?</i> But
your marshes are specially bad. Tell me some more.”</p>

<p>“Call of Spring,” continued Peter, just letting the
murmured words drop from between her lips; “and
the scent of jasmine on a hot night.”</p>

<p>“Tiger again?”</p>

<p>“Um.”</p>

<p>Merle had an inspiration: “What about letting that
tiger graze on the marshes?”</p>

<p>“Bad for it to graze anywhere,” said Peter grimly.
“Then there’s the Marsh of ‘do-you-remember’ and
‘this-time-a-year-ago,’ deep slushy ones, both of them;
particular favourites of mine. And the clash of bells on
New Year’s Eve awakens feelings unutterable within
me. So do soldiers marching past; and a cheering
crowd. I’m attached to the house in which I was born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
I keep letters. I don’t mind Tennyson half as much as
I pretend. And when I read about lonely children, I
cry. And then I can cry at seeing myself cry&mdash;it’s a
most pathetic sight!”</p>

<p>“Is all that genuine?” real concern now in her
friend’s voice.</p>

<p>“Yes.... And sometimes, Merle, I just long to
take the whole bag of tricks and fling them at Stuart’s
head; it would be so good for him!” A half-smile
tilted her lips, as she reflected how she had continually
burlesqued to Stuart these same sentimental weaknesses,
without once letting a hint escape that she
shared in them.</p>

<p>The fire yawned audibly, and plopped a coal into the
stillness. The sense of isolation was thick as cotton-wool.</p>

<p>&mdash;Crunch of footsteps up the path and on the steps.
Then a loud and penetrating double knock. A dog leapt
from the kitchen, barking furiously. Mrs. Trenner was
heard unbolting to the intruder. The door flew open to
great gusts of wind and rain. A gruff voice spoke for
a moment. Retreating steps, closed door, a subdued
whine from the dog ... and Mrs. Trenner brought in
two sopping blurred letters that were the cause of so
much sudden tumult. Then returned again to the
kitchen. Silence swallowed the cottage with a gulp, and
all was as before.</p>

<p>“Both from Stuart,” quoth Merle, handing one
envelope to Peter; “how typical of him to break in
with all that clamour.”</p>

<p>Her communication was the longer of the two, and
took her several minutes to read; once or twice she
laughed aloud at some brilliant flight of nonsense. At
last, according to invariable custom, she tossed the
scribbled-over sheets to Peter for inspection&mdash;“Here
you are,” and held out her hand for the exchange....</p>

<p>Peter did not stir; her fingers clenched a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
tighter on the letter which lay in her lap. Into her eyes
had crept again that look, brooding and replete, to
which Merle had so objected.</p>

<p>... Merle withdrew her hand. Between the two
girls lay the sensation of a moment dead.</p>

<p>One letter which could be shown&mdash;and one which
couldn’t ... Merle understood now.</p>



<p class="tbpara">The journey up to London was an uncomfortable one.
Peter and Merle avoided each other as much as possible.
Never before had they been brought to a pass where
open discussion was mutually barred. Once, Peter
mentioned very casually that Stuart in his letter ...
had summoned them on arrival to meet him straightway
at the Billet-doux for dinner. Merle courteously
acknowledged the invitation. If matters had been
otherwise, she would have rejoiced exceedingly at the
prospect of being hurled direct from their primitive
abode in Carn Trewoofa, to the contrasting blaze and
bustle of a London restaurant. But aware that the
stunt had been arranged for Peter, not for herself, she
wished fervently she could withdraw altogether,
wondered how long she would instinctively be forced
to obey the call of trio, dance to its elusive melody.
How long?&mdash;Why, how long had she already been
fooled to the belief that she was necessary to complete
the figure of three? How long had this&mdash;thing&mdash;been
growing?... The slow train drew up with a jerk at
Exeter, and refused for thirty-five minutes to stir from
beside the wet shining platform. Peter was restless;
thudded with her foot against the ground. And Merle,
knowing now the cause, resented her restlessness:
“She can’t wait till she sees him again.”</p>

<p>After interminable jolts and stoppages, Paddington
Station. Twenty to seven,&mdash;seven o’clock they were
due at the Billet-doux. “What shall we do with our
suit-cases?” “I’m taking mine to Euston waiting-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ready to be picked up on my way home.” “Then
I’ll leave mine at a convenient Tube station; Oxford
Circus will do.”... They were both thankful for the
suit-cases.</p>

<p>A taxi hailed, and directions given. And whereas
Merle, in the whirl through the lit crowded streets,
grieved for the laughter missed, Peter was reproaching
herself for an inexplicable wish to be doing all this alone;
alone to be meeting Stuart at seven o’clock. She had
not seen him since that night on the moors; he had
slipped away the next morning before his companions
were out of bed.</p>

<p>Her excitement grew. Merle looked at her, once, by
the flashing arc of a street-lamp&mdash;then glanced quickly
away again.</p>

<p>Outward circumstances were well in favour of a
successful trio party. Memory of dark green moor and
sun-splashed waves and all the details that went to
make Carn Trewoofa,&mdash;and at the doors of the Billet-doux
behold now Stuart in evening-clothes and silk hat
and a man-about-town set to his eyeglass: “So glad
you could come,” in the Oxford voice,&mdash;had he ever
<em>really</em> shown them his bare grazed knees?</p>

<p>“We do look pirates,” exclaimed Peter, laughingly
conscious of brown throat, and hair tangled to a web by
the salt winds. And indeed, many heads were turned
to gaze after the two girls in stained tweed skirts,
jerseys and caps, threading their defiant way between
the tables, in the wake of the exquisite dandy.</p>

<p>“The same places as at our first supper?” suggested
Stuart.</p>

<p>They assented.</p>

<p>So the mirror reflected the three figures, as once
before. And Merle thought hard of Da Vinci’s masterpiece.
She would have liked to ask if Peter were
visited by the same idea, but remembered in time that
the thread of intimacy had been snapped. Easy enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
now that her eyes were opened, to see what had happened
to the two grown-ups, for thus she contemptuously
classified her comrades; and she imagined their secret
evident in every look and word; their lightest remark
tingling with electricity.</p>

<p>... Just this once she would still be faithful to the
spirit of trio. But oh, how she longed to let them know
that all this elaborate comedy of maintaining for her
benefit a volley of nonsense talk, was merely insulting;
her eyes were clear of dust.</p>



<p class="tbpara">“Do, for pity’s sake, tell me some tales of Orson
Manor, for the edification of grandmaman.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good?” from Peter; “you know that
the very first time I come to lunch, I shall put my hoof
in it up to the hilt.”</p>

<p>Stuart repeated puzzled: “Do hoofs have hilts? do
hilts have hoofs&mdash;hooves&mdash;hilts&mdash;I say, that’s not a bad
pub., the ‘Hoof and Hilt.’ Shall we put it in the Room,
Merle?”</p>

<p>“We have seven already,” she reminded him reproachfully.</p>



<p class="tbpara">... Grown-ups, grown-ups both of them! And
what was the good of forcing the play? To allow love
to happen, just like other grown-ups&mdash;Merle’s lip
curled. Not a man or woman in the assembled crowd
but had at some time of their lives succumbed to this
most ordinary passion. But the trio had boasted of
their difference!... Grown-ups.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Stuart began to spin a marvellous tissue of absurdities
relative to their supposed stay with his sister
Dorothy in Devon. The Spanish waiter came and went
with dishes. In the gleaming mirror, three marionettes
talked and laughed and gesticulated, faithfully mimicking
the originals at their side. At the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
gleaming mirror, three pairs of eyes watched the marionettes,
and marvelled at their likeness to life. At the
table and in the mirror, three ghosts were chanting a
dirge for the playtime that was over. But Merle alone
heard them.</p>



<p class="tbpara">... “It was such a grotesque nightmare,” Peter was
saying; “I was one side of the moon, and a cow the
other. And every time the cow jumped over the moon,
as cows will, I jumped as well, so as always to be on the
other side of the moon to the cow. I’m not partial to
cows. But it was a fearful strain, watching its face,
and trying to guess from the expression exactly when it
intended to jump.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought the double motion would
become mechanical at last, like the Flip-Flap. Did you
know that Mrs. Trenner asked for my address before
I left, that she might send me a lobster fresh from its
native soil? And can you imagine my mother when it
turns up? and the butler? I haven’t the remotest
notion how to account for it; Orson Manor is miles
from the sea, and Dorothy <em>never</em> sends us lobsters.”</p>



<p class="tbpara">Suddenly, from being especially flushed and talkative
and brilliant, Peter dropped to a queer moodiness;
mouth sullen; feet swinging rebelliously against the
leg of the table. She wanted to be alone with Stuart&mdash;wanted
it&mdash;wanted it. Merle’s presence filled her with
an intense exasperation. She tried at first to control
these sensations; the knowledge that they were shared
by Stuart would have gone far towards soothing them.
But Stuart betrayed nothing of his point of view that
night; from the mask of his features, he might
have been totally unaware of aught unusual in the
atmosphere. His manner to both girls was equally
charming ... a skilled juggler, he tossed his ivory
balls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“I only succeeded once in drawing a salt into conversation,”
said Merle gravely; “I couldn’t understand
a word of what he was talking about, except that it
related mainly to whales. So I prattled intelligently in
reply, of harpoons and blubber&mdash;oh, quite professional.
Peter told me afterwards that he was referring to his
summer holiday at Llandudno.”</p>



<p class="tbpara">... “For God’s sake, be quiet!” prayed Peter
inaudibly. All these inanities&mdash;when she and Stuart
might already be embarking on the perilous seas of their
double adventure. Would this ghastly meal never be
over? And then what lay in store? Would he contrive
somehow to snatch a moment alone with her?
Surely ... somehow.</p>

<p>Merle was also curious to see how they would rid
themselves of her superfluous company. She was
disliking Stuart just a little more than Peter. Her anger
against the latter was mixed with a curious sympathy;
if they ever came dispassionately to talk it over, she
knew that each would prove perfectly familiar with the
other’s exact state of mind. But Stuart’s acting, if it
were indeed acting, was a shade more perfect than
either of theirs.</p>

<p>“Have you a train to catch, Peter?” he asked
nonchalantly. Her heart drummed thickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. The 9.40 from Euston.”</p>

<p>He drew out his watch: “9.10. We’ve just time
for liqueurs.”</p>

<p>The girls drank their pale Chartreuse in silence, too
tired, after the long tense day in the train, to make
any further effort. Peter felt thankfully that the time
of her deliverance was at hand.</p>

<p>“We’ll take Peter to Euston, and then I’ll see you
home, Merle,” this in the porch, while they waited for
the page-boy to summon a taxi.</p>

<p>Sharply Peter drew in her breath. What game was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
he playing? Merle ... fragile little fool! Surely for
once she could be trusted to look after herself.</p>

<p>“Do you think we can’t see through that?” shouted
Merle’s pride to Stuart’s courtesy. But she choked
down the longing to make a scene; her good breeding,
put to the test, was proving itself no mere surface
quality.</p>

<p>At Euston, he dashed off into the labyrinth to
reclaim the suit-case and take Peter’s ticket. Nine-thirty-eight
by the clock over the portals.</p>

<p>And now all of Peter was concentrated in the one
consuming longing for a moment alone with him, before
the nine-forty whirled her off to Thatch Lane. She had
forgotten even what she wanted from him, what she
expected the coveted moment to yield her. Only knew
of a frantic desire to be quit of the third voice, the third
presence....</p>

<p>Trio?... Peter hated the Trio.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Come along, quick. You’ll miss your train.” He
hurried them down the stairs and through the gangway&mdash;then
up again&mdash;past the barrier&mdash;on to the platform&mdash;in
time to see the nine-forty steam slowly away.</p>

<p>Peter let escape a long quivering sigh. Reprieved for
a while. There was still a chance.</p>

<p>“When’s the next to Thatch Lane?”</p>

<p>“Ten-thirteen, sir. Express. Number four platform.”</p>

<p>They crossed to number four. And if Peter dragged
behind, Merle likewise dragged. And if Peter swung
ahead&mdash;there was Merle still beside her. Or so it seemed
to Peter’s overwrought fancy. And after about five
minutes’ aimless waiting, she could bear it no longer,
but strolled off by herself, down the dark lonely platform,
till it sloped away to meet a gleaming maze of
rails.</p>

<p>Footsteps in her wake. She mastered herself sufficiently
not to turn, but triumph clamoured within her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
He had understood, and followed, as she intended he
should. The footsteps drew level. It was Merle.</p>

<p>Merle had not noticed the direction Peter had taken;
but discovering the accidental proximity, she tried as
naturally as possible to break an awkward silence:
“This was where we broke the egg, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>For beyond anger and beyond pain, lurked within her
an unspoken wish that Peter would not so far give
herself away; fastidious recoil of girlhood from which
the bloom had&mdash;not been brushed.</p>

<p>She received merely a look in response to her remark.
Then, without speaking, they turned and walked back
to Stuart, who, absorbed in a study of the ownerless
motor-cars that eccentrically bestrew Euston, had
apparently not noticed their absence.</p>

<p>Peter said: “You and Merle had better not wait.
My train won’t be in for another twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. You’ll be all right, won’t you?
I expect Merle is fagged; she’s looking awfully white.
Good night. It’s been rather a successful evening,
hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>The two girls allowed their eyes to meet in a brief
flash of understanding, sympathy even. Then Peter’s
hardened again to antagonism.</p>

<p>“Good night, Stuart. Good night, Merle.”</p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>She was alone. And Euston was in a forbidding mood;
one of those vast black moods which tend to shrink the
individual to the size of a thimble.</p>

<p>Ten&mdash;fifteen minutes. The express thundered in.
Peter stepped into a vacant compartment and sat
staring dully at the framed views on the wall opposite....
So it had never really happened, their fight with the
wind, and the rain-blurred letter afterwards. Never
really happened, or he would have made one sign to
show he remembered. She dreaded the blank journey,
and dreaded the blank night to follow, wondering for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
what length of time her nerves would continue to throb,
throb and pant like the engine of the ten-thirteen. And
now a shudder in the wheels beneath her, and the train
began to move ... faster and faster....</p>

<p>Someone ran alongside, leapt on to the footboard, tore
at the handle of the door. And:</p>

<p>“I told the man to drive like Hell!” said Stuart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Oh, Lord!” reflected Stuart the following morning;
“I believe I was dramatic.”</p>

<p>Not alone this, but having perpetrated the abominable
crime of a “dramatic moment,” he now planned no
deliberate attempt to destroy it. Which was significant.</p>



<p class="tbpara">“Oh Lord!” reflected Peter the following morning;
“I believe I was neurotic.”</p>

<p>She was now perfectly normal and serenely happy.
The sky streamed sunshine, and she wanted to pick
daffodils. Also her recollections of the evening before
were extremely hazy, beyond a disgusted impression
that she had behaved rather badly.</p>

<p>“What on earth could have been the matter with
me?” she splashed herself with cold water, and put on
her best shoes and stockings, by way of signalling her
change of mood. Then came to the comfortable conclusion
that perhaps Merle had noticed nothing. Why,
it was the child’s birthday to-day. They would have
a celebration; perhaps S<span class="lock">tuart&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mature consideration decided that, on the whole,
trios had better be suspended for a while, since their
effect upon her temperament was so demoralizing. No
matter! she and Merle would foot it happily in their
two-world; that was still intact. She would not give
up Merle, nor yet Stuart, nor yet anybody. One-world,
two-world, three-world; and the Room and playtime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and friendship and tigers and daffodils&mdash;she would
keep them all. Why not?</p>

<p>Thus Peter in the train which took her that afternoon
to Euston, and on the ’bus which bore her down
Oxford Street.</p>

<p>... And she was very sorry she had been cross last
night, and Merle must forgive her, and be radiantly
happy as well. Why not? Who could fail to rejoice,
when the earth was thrilling and teeming and bursting
with the knowledge that she and Stuart were going to
be in love. And they would go on going to be, till the
fateful day of have-been. The actual state of love
Peter determined to skip; it was too smug and settled;
too lacking in divine discontent. Thus Peter on the
doorstep of the house in Lancaster Gate. And she
startled Madame des Essarts by singing the Pirate’s
Chorus the whole way up the broad and decorous
staircase:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come, sail with me ercross ther sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ercross ther dork Lergoon&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She knocked at Merle’s door.</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” cried Peter in buoyant voice.</p>

<p>Merle, doing nothing in particular, was standing at
the dressing-table, heaped high with dainty expensive
presents, and notes, and telegrams; tokens whereby
might be gathered that Mademoiselle des Essarts was
twenty-two.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle des Essarts did not return her friend’s
greeting.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” The repetition in a somewhat more subdued
tone.</p>

<p>“Did Stuart catch the train?”</p>

<p>“How did you know?” Peter queried, astonished.</p>

<p>“I heard him tell the driver to hurry, the instant
he had deposited me on my doorstep. ‘Drive like
Hell!’ was his exact expression, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes ... he just turned up in time;” a distinctly
subdued voice now. There was something ominous
about Merle’s lovely little face; and Peter was not
quite so sure about keeping the two-world intact.</p>

<p>“I say&mdash;Merle&mdash;was I a beast yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no; you were delightful.” It might have
been the grandmother speaking in those tones of frozen
hauteur. Then suddenly: “You’re in love with each
other, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Peter tossed off her hat and coat. “Don’t be&mdash;crude.”</p>

<p>“Crude!” the other blazed forth; “perhaps you
think you weren’t crude&mdash;last night.”</p>

<p>“Last night was a mood; and I apologize. I’m
quite normal again.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. He caught the train.”</p>

<p>“Merle,” Peter’s eyes were deep and troubled; “you
mustn’t say that sort of thing. You. You said it as if
you meant it; as <span class="lock">if&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“As if what?”</p>

<p>“As if you were jealous,” Peter blurted out.</p>

<p>“I am. Oh&mdash;not of Stuart; he doesn’t count in this,
except that I dislike him for daring to interfere, after all
we’ve been to each other.”</p>

<p>The speech seemed to awake an echo in the room.
Peter was faintly conscious of just such another scene
as this, though when and where she could not remember.</p>

<p>“Need he interfere?” she said at last, haltingly.
Then: “I say, we’re not quarrelling, are we?”</p>

<p>Merle smiled: “Yes, I believe we are.” Then her
look shadowed once more. “Do you think I’m going
through again what I sat through at that horrible
supper? The knowledge of being in the way; unwanted;
seeing between you two that secret current of understanding,
and all the while having to pretend I was
unaware of it. The trio is dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead. And it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
not I who have killed it. It’s you and Stuart. We found
the most wonderful playtime that ever was&mdash;but you
had to drag in love, like any other two people of
opposite sex.”</p>

<p>Peter crossed to the window, her back to the room:
“It might equally well have been Stuart and you.”</p>

<p>“For me, the point lies in the fact that it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“You’d have acted the same. A man and two girls&mdash;what
else could we expect, admitting him?”</p>

<p>In the dignified street below, a long line of lights
sprang into a sudden curve of brilliance athwart the
dusk. With one hand, Peter held aside the tapestried
hangings ... and the touch brought with it great
floods of memory. Echoes?&mdash;she had traced back the
echoes now. This quarrel had been rehearsed. The
Inevitable had recoiled with ironic effect on those who
had dared mock it with burlesque.</p>

<p>She wondered at what point Merle would remember
the pretence drama they had perpetrated of jealousy
and farewell, when the question was first raised of
admitting a third to their union. But Merle was
blinded by a royal rage, would see nothing clearly till
she had delivered herself of the pent-up storm of
emotion:</p>

<p>“We were to have been so different; we three. Oh,
how could you spoil it? I’ve seen thousands look at
each other as you looked at one another last night&mdash;but
where am I to find the games and the nursery again?
Real children can’t play as we did ... and you and
Stuart have fallen in love!” Her delicate features
quivered with scorn for the two who could not keep it
up; who had dropped from the kingdom of magic
strange and new, to an old, old kingdom of magic; old
as the hills and the seas and the oldest road.</p>

<p>Peter said never a word. She was afraid to speak, for
fear of again treading on the heels of that former
occasion. It was too absurd that they should thus be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
repeating themselves, in the very same setting, and
neither able to laugh at it.</p>

<p>“And we knew.” Merle went on, in performance of
just that which Peter dreaded; “if we hadn’t known
beforehand&mdash;but we knew, and courted the danger; we
did it <span class="lock">ourselves&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Don’t!” from Peter ... and she walked sharply
away from that&mdash;that damnable window.</p>

<p>Then it struck Merle. “Oh, I see. Yes, it is rather
funny.” She laughed drearily. “The scene ought to
go well, considering we’ve played it before. A pity the
parts are reversed. You preferred the rôle of Unwanted
Woman, as giving more scope to your histrionic powers.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” pleaded Peter; and, hands outspread
against the toilet-table behind her, she faced Merle
squarely; “this sort of sparring isn’t worthy of us.
For Heaven’s sake, let’s try and get a sane grip of the
business.”</p>

<p>“In exactly that position?” murmured Merle, who
had not slept as well as Peter, and was inclined to be
relentless.</p>

<p>Desperately Peter dropped her hands; and wondered
if there were one place in the whole room that she had
not by farce made untenable.</p>

<p>“Can’t we throw him out even now?” but while she
spoke, she knew it impossible.</p>

<p>“Pleasant companion you’d be under those circumstances,”
remarked the half-bitter, half-mocking accents
that sounded so strange from Merle. As if weary of
conflict, she seated herself on the edge of the bed; the
tapestried canopy casting a deep shadow on the pale
cameo of her face.</p>

<p>“All over, Peter.” She held out her hand, with a
gesture almost friendly. “You can’t keep the two of us,
my dear, so stop thinking you can. Stuart can give
you all that I give you, and his manhood into the
bargain. So you’re all right. But if I did consent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
stay in, I’d be aware all the while of a great chunk in
your life that you were keeping hidden from me. And
we’d be constantly hitting on allusions, and backing
away from them, and being tactful,&mdash;and it would all
be very feverish and very uncomfortable. What we’ve
had has been too complete to spoil by compromise.
It’s over, Peter.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t over,” Peter retorted fiercely. “I won’t
have it over!” And she pushed hard at the Inevitable.</p>

<p>“Can you give up Stuart?”</p>

<p>“No,” softly.</p>

<p>“Peter, that wonderful type of friendship doesn’t
exist, where the one left out rejoices at the good fortune
of the other. If <em>I</em> had tumbled into Paradise with some
man, could you have listened to my exuberant confidences,
and been noble about them?”</p>

<p>And again Peter said softly, “No.”</p>

<p>Merle lay back among the pillows, hands clasped
behind her head.... At any moment she might cry:
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax</i>, Peter, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax</i>!”...</p>

<p>“I can’t bear to be the one who lags, for whom allowances
must be made, passion suppressed. There’s
nothing to be done, Peter; we’ve quarrelled, and
we’re going to part for ever. Humiliating, isn’t it?
I wonder just how we got here.”</p>

<p>“Playing at God,” muttered Peter savagely; and
slung her cloak around her shoulders, rammed her hat
on to her head. She felt she could not stand much more.
Every bit of her was aching to throw strong arms about
the slight figure lying on the elaborate brocade bedspread;
hold her tight, in defiance of the ridiculous notion that
anything could possibly arise between them, with which
their boyish brains and sense of humour and glorious
intimacy would be unable to cope.&mdash;And then arose
memories of last night ... one must pay for these
little primitive displays. With fatal clarity, she saw
Merle’s point of view. Not for the victor to insult by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
generosity, to dictate terms of peace; according to
their code, Peter, as top-dog, was powerless to make
overtures; she must simply acquiesce.</p>

<p>“If&mdash;when ... the other thing is done with&mdash;&mdash;?”
she began.</p>

<p>“Not even then. It would never look the same....”</p>

<p>(Peter bit her lip, anticipating with sickening exactitude
the end of the sentence.)</p>

<p>... “Even after mending,” finished Merle. And a
spasm of anger shook the other girl from head to foot:
Merle must be selecting these particular phrases on
purpose!</p>

<p>But it was this same nightmare sense of stepping
again in her own footprints, that took Peter draggingly
to the door. And: “I shall want to come back and
talk about it when I get to the foot of the stairs,” she
said, obedient to phantom promptings.</p>

<p>Merle made reply: “Of course. So will I.”</p>

<p>The ghost of a sham farewell had completed its subtle
revenge. There was no more to be said. So Peter
went.</p>

<p>On the steps of the house at Lancaster Gate, the
knowledge returned, like the flutter of banners in the
sunshine, that for her the world still contained Stuart.</p>

<p>... Quite irrelevantly, it also struck her that she
had omitted to wish Merle many happy returns of the
day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE CASKET LINED WITH PINK</span></h3>


<p>It was such a very large room. And the child left
over wanted badly to cry, because her toys had
all been broken, because it was her birthday,
because Peter had gone. But who could possibly cry
in such a very large room, that unwound itself and
escaped at the corners, whenever she tried to seek comfort
in tucking the walls close about her like an eiderdown
quilt. She could have cried in a little room, quite
easily; but this regal apartment was Second Empire&mdash;somebody
important had slept here once.</p>

<p>Nicole knocked and entered: “It is time for Mademoiselle
to dress. Is Mademoiselle completely rested?”
beaming, she exhibited an elaborate bouquet, white
lilac and lilies of the valley, that had just been sent by
a middle-aged admirer from the Legation.</p>

<p>Madame des Essarts trailed in, to discuss in what
costume Merle would shine to the best advantage, at
the dinner-party given in her honour that evening.</p>

<p>“The apricot ninon? What do you think, Nicole?”</p>

<p>Nicole was in favour of a quaint old-rose brocade,
which suited Mademoiselle <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à merveille</i>. Merle was
invited to take part in the discussion. She could have
indicated a startling preference for a sea-faded jersey
and cap ... but she said that she preferred the brocade.
Her grandmother laid cool fingers, heavily beringed,
upon her head.</p>

<p>“Mignonne, we must call in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce bon</i> Docteur Dufour
again; you are slightly feverish. The excitement of
your fête, is that it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Merle smiled. A doll had returned to its elaborate
wrappings; a bon-bon was replaced in its satin casket;
a jewel laid back in its nest of cotton-wool. Merle
smiled: Yes, she was excited because it was her birthday.
Nice things always happened on one’s birthday,
was it not so? And murmuring benignly an epigram
on <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la jeunesse</i>, Madame departed to put herself in the
hands of the coiffeur.</p>

<p>Merle lay back among the pillows, and watched Nicole
laying out silk stockings and embroidered shoes; soft
underwear; a string of pearls; a handkerchief edged
in fine old lace; Nicole, drawing the curtains, fetching
hot water.... “Good Heavens! that I should own
a friend who owns a maid. You know it’s quite easy to
pull on your stockings, once you’ve learnt the way”&mdash;How
long would the memory of Peter’s mischievous
remarks entangle themselves like alien threads through
the dainty artificial pattern that must henceforth be
woven only in dim pastels and misted silver?</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is now ready for me to arrange her
hair?” Ablutions performed, Merle slipped around
her a silk kimono. The monogrammed tortoise-shell
hair-brushes stood at hand on the panelled dressing-table;
the room was deliciously warm, and fragrant
with the scent of white lilac. Merle had enjoyed with
all her heart this parade of luxury and ceremonial when
it had stood as contrast to her secret life of adventure
with Peter; their stolen days, their long tramps&mdash;oh,
it had been fun, while roughing it, to remember Nicole
and the waiting casket lined with pink.</p>

<p>But now the casket stood for all there was; the
tortoise-shell toilet-service had to be taken seriously;
and Merle’s eyes, looking back at her from the oval
mirror, were wide and frightened with the knowledge
that one could not laugh alone.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Mademoiselle des Essarts, in old-rose brocade and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pearls, stands beside Madame in the Louis salon, and,
with charming self-possession, helps to receive the entering
guests. And now they have all arrived: well-known
figures in foreign ministerial circles; courteous and
urbane old gentlemen wearing decorations; brilliant
and polished young gentlemen from the various embassies;
the two daughters of the new Consul (invited
because they were of Merle’s age); the elegant wives
of numerous consuls; the white-haired Marchese di
Salvador, whose rule it is never to make a remark that
is not unpleasant; finally, a middle-aged member of
the Legation, tall, kindly, and distinguished, his head
already beflecked with grey: Jean Raoul Théodore,
Comte de Cler, who so admires Mademoiselle des Essarts,
and is enchanted to find that he is to lead her down to
dinner.</p>

<p>General conversation round the table is mostly of a
political nature, and carried on in foreign languages,
the assembled company slipping with ease from one
tongue to another. Merle’s partner considerately leaves
her alone, remarking with instinctive delicacy that
the charming child beside him is troubled, and not in
a mood to talk. But presently le Vicomte d’Alençon
turns from a spirited contest with the Marchese, to
Merle on his other side, and enquires if she has received
many gifts in celebration of the day which seventeen
years ago was responsible for such a beautiful and talented
addition to the world. His tone is sugary and indulgent,
as to a petted child. She blushes and deprecates, correcting
his mistake&mdash;“Twenty-two? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma non è possibile!</i>”&mdash;and
watches him return with unmistakable
relief to his argument with the Marchese.... “I
agree with you, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>, he should never have been put
in responsible office; I will see what can be done....”</p>

<p>Undoubtedly fascinating to insiders, this game of
diplomacy. Merle would not be averse to be admitted
as equal to the intricacies of wire-pulling, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
being tossed an occasional sugar-plum to keep her
quiet; but she realizes that these people are justified
in thrusting her outside of their world&mdash;why is she not
in her own? The universe is a series of cosy cubicles,
but dreary for the strays who wander beyond the drawn
curtains.... She sends a swift thought to the Room,
the Perfect Piratical Playroom. Will it be sub-let,
now that two of its owners are grown-up? And she
imagines a grave discussion with Peter and Stuart on
the subject of a suitable tenant, who would be kind to
the giraffe, and keep on Squeith as included in the inventory,
and....</p>

<p>&mdash;Twinkling the pear-shaped emeralds in her ears,
the wife of the new Consul asks deferentially of her
hostess if her little granddaughter will be allowed to
spend a week-end at their country-seat: “My two girls
here are of her age, I believe; and they would be so
delighted, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chère</i> Madame.”</p>

<p>Madame is also delighted, and vouches enthusiastically
for Merle’s delight. And the two daughters
murmur their double delight, and wish Merle were
not so beautiful, and continue to coquette with the
young gentlemen from the embassies.</p>

<p>“But lately one never sees <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cette méchante petite</i>,”
shrills the widowed sister-in-law of Madame; “she
neglects <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la vieille tante</i> shamefully.”</p>

<p>“Merle is so much with her special friend,” Madame
explains in apology; “Peter Kyndersley&mdash;a sweet girl;
they are inseparable. Even now they have but just
returned from a visit to Devonshire.”</p>

<p>“Ah, she must indeed have enjoyed that,”&mdash;they are
talking <em>at</em> Merle, not to her&mdash;“And how well she is
looking.”</p>

<p>“The fresh air,” says Madame; and turns the subject.
Youth has received sufficient attention for the
moment.</p>

<p>... Dancing before Merle’s eyes, a sudden vision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a tea-party of nice young girls, to celebrate her last
year’s natal day, and the arrival of Peter in the rôle
of Inseparable Friend, bearing the present of a particularly
hideous work-basket: “<em>Dearest</em> Merle, <em>so</em> many
happy returns of the day. Just a <em>little</em> remembrance
for your birthday; oh, a mere nothing, but I always
say it’s the <em>spirit</em> and not the <em>gift</em> that matters!” A
murmur of approbation here from grandmother, aunts,
and visitors&mdash;and Merle, meeting the wicked twinkle
in Peter’s eye, controls herself with difficulty.</p>

<p>&mdash;Last year.</p>

<p>And again: “We can’t quarrel really,” laughed Peter,
“because of your grandmother. One would hear nothing
but: ‘You never ask that charming Peter Kyndersley
to tea, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chèrie</i>, and you were once so fond of her.’...”</p>

<p>Well, that will have to be gone through as well.</p>

<p>The table is one blaze and glitter; the light falling
on the Salviati vases; wine trembling and reflecting in
the long-stemmed glasses; vivid splashes of fruit and
flowers; flash of epigram from one lip to another. The
Marchese is in great form to-night.... “Oh, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">là là</i>!”
and peals of <span class="lock">laughter&mdash;</span></p>

<p>... Peter ... Peter....</p>

<p>The other two will not miss the games so intensely;
they had played because it was their nature to play,
as now they loved because it was their nature to love.
But Merle had played for all her wasted years of Château
and Convent; played for the prim little maiden with
her toes turned out, who hung in a frame on the wall of
the boudoir; played for all the children of all the world
who had not the chance to play enough....</p>

<p>“But you are grown-up. Grown-ups cannot play.”</p>

<p>“We did! we did!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? Were <em>they</em> playing&mdash;all the time?”</p>

<p>Had they indeed ever played, all three of them
together? Yes; Merle saw clearly now when the change
had occurred; when the pendulum, vibrating equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
between herself and Peter, had swung completely over.
It was after the April night when Stuart had come to
her in his trouble, and she had given him comfort.</p>

<p>“But he asked for it&mdash;I only gave him what he asked
for.”</p>

<p>Just so, my dear. Just so.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Merle! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chèrie!</i>”</p>

<p>Merle starts guiltily from her absorption; becomes
aware of Monsieur le Vicomte d’Alençon, as the oldest
present, making a few appropriate remarks in her
honour. He tugs his white imperial; bows gracefully
in the direction of the so charming granddaughter
of their so delightful <span class="lock">hostess&mdash;</span></p>

<p>And now they are all clinking and drinking to the
good health and good fortune of Mademoiselle des
Essarts!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It’s Merle’s birthday,” said Peter, facing Stuart
over their particular table at the Billet-doux.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll drink to Merle’s good health,” Stuart
replied.</p>

<p>Glasses raised&mdash;eyes meeting steadily over the rims&mdash;meeting
steadily&mdash;kindling to <span class="lock">flame&mdash;</span></p>

<p>By the time the circular stems again touch the table-cloth,
Merle is forgotten.</p>


<p class="p2 center">END OF PART I</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>




<h2>PART II</h2>




<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smaller">HAIRPIN VISION</span></h3>


<p>Stuart said: “Everything’s worth dying for,
or else nothing would be worth living for.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” Peter queried, “that dying
and living are of equal unimportance?”</p>

<p>“Equal importance.”</p>

<p>They were seated side by side upon a luggage-truck,
in a deserted vaulty corner on the outskirts of Euston.
In front of them were ranged battalions of empty
luggage-trucks, standing stiffly at attention. From far
away rolled in waves the hollow reverberating echoes
that are part of a great terminus. All about them,
enormous stone pillars stood sentinel, their tops presumably
lost in a murky infinity; but robbed of majesty
by the absurd fretwork of vine-leaves that encircled
their base.</p>

<p>The occupants of this draughty suburb were not so
much waiting for a train to convey Peter to Thatch Lane,
as awaiting the moment they themselves should be
seized by desire for a train; when, strolling forth to
investigate, they usually found the very article just
about to leave the platform. Such was the never-waning
influence of Stuart’s star, in which, by dint of
her proximity, Peter had assumed a share, with the
same ease as she would have displayed coming under
another’s umbrella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“Of equal importance,” Stuart maintained, reverting
to their argument; “if death be essential for the
completion of a moment, no person ought to let their
rubbishy life stand in the way. The moment’s the thing.
To walk about attaching such a tremendous weight to
the value of the-breath-in-my-body, and none at all to
the fun which can be extracted from ignoring it, is the
unbalanced attitude of all people who have no sense of
form.”</p>

<p>Peter was straining to follow him; she could almost
hear her brain creak with the effort.</p>

<p>“If by the hairpin vision, you glimpse an act as
needing for completion the sacrifice of your life, you’d
give it?”</p>

<p>“Every time. By way of proving the vital importance
of the act. And if all were to throw themselves
more recklessly into the impersonal spirit of formation,
we’d be done with age and illness, with fears and frets
and muddle and blind gropings. Hanging-on is the evil.
I’d like to make a pool, a Greatest Common Factor,
into which each man is ready at all times to chuck his
life for the sake of living, snap the thread for the sake
of the pattern.”</p>

<p>“H’m. It’s superb, but does it hold water? The
gift of supreme <span class="lock">selflessness&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Supreme priggishness! ’Tisn’t that. It’s to a
fellow’s personal advantage to see just where he’s going,
where to stop, where to snap. The vision demands certain
sacrifice, of course.” Stuart chuckled. “I’m pleased
with the notion of offering myself as a burnt-offering to
myself,” he declared; “such a compliment!”</p>

<p>Peter chanted: “And they could not find an ox nor
an ass, nor a signpost nor a manservant, nor diamonds
nor decanters, nor pork nor porridge, worthy to be
sacrificed to the supreme master of all, son of the house
of Heron. Then himself uprose, and stripped him of his
braces and other adornments of the <span class="lock">flesh&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>But the metaphysician was again in the ascendant;
leprechaun had but drummed an instant with shaggy
heels, to make sure of not being forgotten.</p>

<p>“Peter, we must know when to cut, you and I.
There’ll come the moment, inevitably; and if we don’t
act in time, it will be done for us, and just too late.”</p>

<p>“When the last juice is out of the orange,” she quoted.</p>

<p>“And the taste of the skin is already bitter in the
mouth.” He considered her steadfastly: “I wonder if
you are up to it,” he mused; “it would be rather a
magnificent stunt, really and truly to cheat the gods of
their aftermath. Could you, Peter? You devil, I
believe you could ... I’m not sure that I want you
defiant enough for that.”</p>

<p>Thus Stuart to the conception of Peter which he had
built from his own desire and from the cavalier tilt of
her head. And seeing clearly his Portrait-of-a-Lady;
battle-eager and brain-clear and courageous; glorying
in freedom from all bondage; a lady with mockery on
her lips, and sudden moods of tenderness in her soul, as
of mist veiling softly a shining sword; swift in recovery
after defeat; tempered at all times to fine adjustment
of the spirit to circumstance and adventure; and withal
a lady mysterious and unexpected, but of bodily hardihood
like to a man’s; and, above everything, able to
stand alone and without him;&mdash;seeing all this, and finding
the portrait attractive, she had played up to it; at
first for fun; then because it came as natural to do so
as not; then for his sake; finally, because she could no
more extricate herself.</p>

<p>One effort indeed she had made in the latter direction:
“Stuart, has it ever struck you that you have mixed
the oranges in your basket? and when you think to be
employed with mine, it is your own you are busily
sucking all the while.”</p>

<p>He laughed, not grasping the significance of what she
said. “What of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well&mdash;no wonder you approve of the flavour!”</p>

<p>“You’re a dentist, Peter!” he cried then, exasperated;
“you bring forth the hidden molars of my mind,
molars of which I myself am not even aware, and dangle
them on your nasty little pincers, saying: ‘Look, this is
yours!’ It’s a horrid, a most reprehensible trick.”</p>

<p>She abandoned the attempt at revelation; continued
to respond to his conception of her: never to tell him
when she was tired; never to own that she had need
of him; never to let him see her afraid; never to ask
his help in trouble. Herein lay the primary rules to be
observed. And she had learnt from him actually to
enjoy the utmost limits of strain; found exhilaration
in the knowledge that after all, she was top-dog in the
silent battle, since she had so successfully restrained her
real nature from proclaiming to him its hidden wants
and weaknesses. Top-dog&mdash;a pity that this superiority
must be for ever kept secret, when one considered how
he would be annoyed at the information.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she doubted if her powers were capable
of this final test, complete severance at the topmost
summit of happiness, in avoidance of descent on the
further side. This was super-girl he demanded now.
Perversely, she experienced a hatred of his talk of
evanescence and the separation to come; wished to
hear the old foolish “for-ever-an’-ever” on his lips,
the old mad belief in immortality of love, which her
reason rejected so scornfully. Were they a pair of fools
too clever for love? Peter questioned silently of the
luggage-trucks. Beyond the fading rails, beyond the
last red-eyed signal-box, a train-whistle hooted derisively.</p>

<p>“Stuart, if we went on without use of the shears,
what do you see in store for us?”</p>

<p>Resting his chin on his hands, he gazed beyond the
towering pillars, as if in the attempt to throw a loop
around the future and pull it into his line of vision.</p>

<p>“Knowledge of each other, worst of all. Knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that is bound to widen, and each day lick up a little
more of the unknown territory, till none remains. I
shall fight hard not to know you, Peter; not to anticipate
your attitude, or expect your unexpectedness, or
follow too confidently and without trepidation your
mental twists and turns. But it’s a losing fight. And
one day we shall experience a sensation of things
commonplace, the tingle gone from them.”</p>

<p>“We won’t tell....”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t tell; we’ll try and whip up by artificial
means. I might marry you in that mood&mdash;from a
sort of desperation at having pushed beyond desire.
There are no hills and no stars in the country that lies
beyond desire. I think, seeing it, one of us will make a
half-hearted attempt to break. But too late to glory
in the break; it will merely be odious and necessary,
with the past already spoiled, and the future rather
bleak; a break complicated by entanglements and&mdash;oh,
other people! So we shall drift together again, as a
matter of habit, somewhat ashamed of <span class="lock">ourselves&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Peter was seeing it now: “You will begin to take me
for granted, and not strain to please me. And I&mdash;I
might possibly become <span class="lock">exacting&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“That phase would pass as well. We should grow
older, more comfortable, wonder what the uneasiness
had all been about, and the sense of loss. Impulse
would slip away and topsy-turvydom and conceit”&mdash;Stuart
waxed pathetic at the contemplated loss of his
insufferable bumptiousness,&mdash;“and, sane together, we
will wonder we could ever have been mad together. If I
must age to sanity, damn it! I’ll face the process alone.”</p>

<p>“You won’t remember ... but I shall, on anniversaries.
I hate dates, but I can’t break them of their
meaning&mdash;that’s my sex coming through. Anniversaries
... when I shall have known you a year&mdash;two
years&mdash;three&mdash;Stuart, I’m frightened of the years; I
want to be meeting you again for the first time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“We haven’t come to that yet. But when we do&mdash;the
world may label me a brute or you a jilt; they may
expect you to cling, or me to reproach; they may talk
of the steady affection which grows and subsists upon a
durable basis of mutton-fat,&mdash;but when we touch top,
Peter, as we two shall do simultaneously, because we
are level, then it’s: ‘Thanks for what you’ve given me,
and good-bye,’ proudly and cleanly. I never thought
I should meet the genius of life who could do that.”
And he repeated softly his tribute: “You are a genius
of life, Peter....”</p>

<p>Then, fearful of an imposed descent from the clear
heights, he gave a rapid exhibition of his own unprompted
skill at banister-sliding: “Eleven times two is twenty-two!”
he recited, awestruck, catching sight of figures
roughly scrawled in white chalk on the pillars opposite;
“eleven times three is thirty-three! O, far-reaching
hand of <span class="lock">education&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Not so far,” laughed Peter, following him down
with remarkable celerity; “eleven times eleven is <em>not</em>
a hundred and eleven, well, not usually! and our unknown
mathematician seems himself to have had doubts
on the subject, for he has broken off at that juncture of
reckoning.”</p>

<p>Stuart evoked a touching image of the Self-Improving
Porter, hoping one day to be a County Councillor; and
stealing away from his soulless burden of trundling, to
practise his tables in stillness and solitude upon the
props of Euston.</p>

<p>“Euston more than any other place will be a home
of ghosts, after we have finally torn ourselves asunder,”
remarked Peter, as they strolled through dim archways
into the circular booking-hall. “You, of course, can
avoid the building; but unless I contrive to alight
always at Kilburn, which will be inconvenient, my raw
wounds will be kept well salted.” She glanced down at
the sprawling silent figures from which the wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
benches were never free; phantom figures for ever
waiting for some phantom train; never moving, never
asking,&mdash;indissoluble adjuncts to the mystery of Euston.
“I will not consent to have my feelings lacerated in
chance fashion,” she declared; “I’m going to take you
now, and solemnly lay you, as a hen lays eggs, in different
portions of the building; so that in years to come I
shall know exactly at what points to wince with a sudden
pain. If we arrange our own exists, we will also premeditate
our own agonies.”</p>

<p>Peter had not yet learnt to refrain from playing at
God.</p>

<p>So thrice they sought to trespass in the gallery which,
close up to the smoke-black ceiling, ringed the hall.
And were twice ejected by a sympathetic stoker; and
once by a policeman, who smiled not nor scowled when
Stuart quoted to him art and Lucullus in argument
against the law, but said simply and stolidly, “Maybe,
sir, but them’s my orders,” which is the essential
condition of mind for a policeman, and one to be encouraged,
ranking him in excellence beside the Self-Improving
Porter. And they sought for the elusive
platform, from which trains are rumoured to depart on
Sundays, but which on all other days lies beyond platform
nine, and beyond the world, and beyond space;
drifting formless platform to which the evil familiars
of Euston occasionally lure a harmless passenger-train,
then to chuckle at the bewildered victims of their
devilry. And they found also the platform of a thousand
milk-cans; and a model steamship in a glass case,
reported to perform marvellous feats at the insertion
of one penny, but which, clutching Stuart’s penny to
its iron breast, stirred not from tranced sleep; thinking
doubtless: he is a millionaire and can well spare it.
And they planned to hold a Roman feast on a great
scale, in the bathroom at Euston; weary sooty travellers
to be lured inside and plunged forthwith into cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
floods of water, and given stale sandwiches to eat, and
a third-class ticket to Willesden, gratis with every bar
of soap. Finally, they entered Euston through seven
different portals, beheld it from seven different aspects,
all fearsome with the clankings and throbbings of metal,
and the oblique approach of red goblin eyes from the
outside glooms.</p>

<p>And Peter said that her train was due, and that the
premises were now quite sufficiently imbued with sad
sweet memories hereafter as ghosts to haunt her.</p>

<p>“It would be rather funny if my aching heart should
turn inartistic and refuse to perform.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if we can’t cheat Ladye Art, at our age!” he
leant against the door of the carriage, and lit a cigarette;
“she belongs to the first stages of consciousness. I put
out my tongue at Art. A man with the artistic sense
of things, would never again take you home by train
to Thatch Lane, after having once done it so successfully;
‘for fear of spoiling things,’ he would say.”</p>

<p>The guard passed along the line of doors, his passage
punctuated by heavy slams.</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;&mdash;” she mocked.</p>

<p>“But I, Peter, can be artistic, and also cheat Art by
being inartistic;” he placed a tentative foot upon the
step, and she anticipated his evident intentions by a
careless: “I don’t need you with me to-night.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“And then cheat myself by being re-artistic!”
he ran alongside the moving train, and secured the door-handle
by a deft turn of the wrist. “And I had no
intention of coming with you, Peter. Good night!”</p>

<p>... Peter hated him. It struck her that the most
poignant ghost of all, and one where she had no hand
in the manufacture, would run for ever abreast of a
moving train; leap on to the footboard: “I told the
man to drive like Hell!”... leap from the footboard:
“I had no intention of coming with <span class="lock">you&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>And here were the ends of Euston, where the trio had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
chanted their triumphant ritual; where Peter had once
taken her tiger a-walking, and Merle had followed her.
Merle....</p>

<p>Blackness now, save for a few splashed lights among
a dark huddle of roofs. Then open country.</p>

<p>Yes, she hated Stuart. He might have known that
she did rather want him to come. He <em>had</em> <span class="lock">known&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Peter smiled. She was mentally framing a letter to
him, of which this was the opening phrase: “If you
had no intention of coming, why, oh why, did you hold
in your hand <em>two</em> first-class tickets to Thatch Lane, when
you returned from the booking-office?”</p>

<p>It was just as well, Peter decided, to keep cultivated
and alert one’s powers of observation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smaller">A PRODIGAL FATHER</span></h3>


<p>Alighting at the tiny station of Thatch Lane,
she was immediately lapped around with a
cool bath of air, refreshing as water after the
dust and turmoil of a day in London. She walked
quickly along the tree-lined road; each house a sleeping
mystery divided from the next by a dimness of hedge
and garden. Occasionally a light-pricked window; footfall
of an invisible passer-by; long echoing shriek from
the railway line, as the train in a rushing curve was
seen cleaving the fields.</p>

<p>Peter halted beneath a solitary lamp-post, swung
open a white gate on her left, passed up the neat gravel
path of Bloemfontein, and, bringing forth her latchkey,
was just about to let herself in, when she became aware
of a blurred bundle, somewhat darker than the darkness,
squatting on the steps.</p>

<p>“Hullo!”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” responded the bundle forlornly.</p>

<p>“Have you lost your way?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but there’s nobody to open to us.”</p>

<p>Peter had not looked upon the huddled form in the
light of an evening caller: “I’m sorry, I thought you
were a beggar&mdash;No, I don’t mean that&mdash;but it’s awfully
dark, isn’t it?” with a quick attempt to retrieve her
blunder. “But who are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, I’m Chavvy!”</p>

<p>Came a heavy step upon the gravel. A looming
figure returned from what had evidently been a tour of
exploration round the back premises:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“No luck, my dear. All bolted, even the pantry
window. We shall just have to wait.”</p>

<p>“Father!” exclaimed Peter, relieved from her equal
fear of burglars or eccentric demigods, which latter she
recollected were in the habit of occasionally week-ending
with unsuspecting mortals.</p>

<p>“That you, Peter? Hooray, hooray! Can you let
us into this infernal house? we’ve been knocking since
half an hour,” Bertram Kyndersley sounded not a whit
depressed by the occurrence.</p>

<p>“Aunt Esther is out. But cook had no right to leave
the house alone.” Peter inserted the key, and opened
to a square hall, blue-papered, with pleasant glimpses
beyond of a gas-lit dining-room, its table spread with
wine and fruit, with seed-cake and cress sandwiches.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming in, Chavvy?” the man spoke
impatiently, of a sudden convinced that something was
wrong with a universe that permitted to his daughter a
latchkey, while himself was forced to nocturnal prowlings
and pantry windows.</p>

<p>“May I&mdash;Pierrot?”</p>

<p>“Good God, yes!” he helped the bundle to its feet,
and brought it into the hall. Peter, who from the high
plaintive tones had expected to see a child, was astonished
when Chavvy resolved itself into a girl some four or five
years older than herself; though stunted in growth, and
with dark hair scattered loosely about the shoulders.
She wore an odd assortment of what looked like rags,
but taken separately, proved a faded green jersey, a
brown muffler, scanty red skirt, coloured stockings
gaping with huge holes, shoes likewise ornamented, and
a Neapolitan red fishing-cap that didn’t match the
skirt.</p>

<p>Bertram too had a threadbare appearance, though
his waist-line had considerably increased its girth of
late, and his eye seemed to have melted more than was
good for it. Nothing could detract, however, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
certain picturesqueness which clung about him like an
aroma, and he met Peter’s mildly wondering gaze with
his old jaunty smile.</p>

<p>“This is my wife, Peter!”&mdash;and waited to be cursed
or blessed, as fortune decreed.</p>

<p>Chavvy took an impulsive step forward, both hands
held out: “Please ... we are so tired and cold and
hungry ... and&mdash;and I promise never to come between
you and Pierrot!”</p>

<p>“Pierrot?” Peter felt that this sobriquet bestowed
upon her slightly obese parent, added the last absurd
touch of unreality to the situation:</p>

<p>Pierrot and Chavvy&mdash;the doorstep vigil&mdash;tired and
cold and hungry&mdash;the prodigal and the play-actress&mdash;certainly
a snowstorm was lacking, but Miss Esther on
her return home might be trusted to supply this last
essential.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with all her artificial appeal, there was
about poor little third-rate Chavvy something genuinely
pathetic, though one felt instinctively that this was her
favourite adjective and ought not to be encouraged;
genuinely pathetic in the north-east, where she saw herself
attractively pathetic in the south-west. Peter was
irresistibly reminded of the touring road-companies
she had known in her pre-Bloemfontein days; their
jargon, their manners, and careless bonhomie. And in
this spirit she bade her stepmother heartily welcome.</p>

<p>“Come in, both of you; cut all explanations, they
don’t matter much, any old way! And help yourselves
to whatever you want in the food line. I say, though,
you’re shivering,&mdash;half a jiff, while I light a fire! Rather
eccentric in June&mdash;Auntie’s hair will stand on end
when she sees. Yes, that’s right, off with your jersey
and cap, sling them anywhere ... what pretty hair
you’ve got.” Peter talked very fast, concealing
intense amusement at her father’s latest escapade, and
uncaring that the trimly conventional dining-room was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
being transformed as if by magic to a fair replica of
cheap theatrical lodgings: Chavvy squatting on the
hearthrug, her sharp white features lit by the wavering
flames, the while she peeled a tangerine and carelessly
littered the skin in the fender; jersey, cap and muffler
tossed anyhow on the floor; firescreen (hand-painted
with lilies) upset; Bertram lounging in an arm-chair, his
boots half-way up the mantelpiece, and spilling wherever
most convenient the ash of a particularly foul-smelling
cigar; a glass of port streaming its contents across the
white cloth, and dripping slowly from the table’s edge;
crumbs on every plate; Peter herself astride the table,
listening to irrelevant anecdotes of shoddy people whose
names she did not even know, and delighting at the
taint of vulgarity within her which woke so very
naturally to the prevailing atmosphere.</p>

<p>&mdash;“By the way,” she interrupted a stirring narrative
of how one Billy Devereux&mdash;such a dear boy&mdash;had been
slung out of work because the leading lady&mdash;vain old
beast&mdash;had bestowed his rôle and her affections upon a
youth with longer eyelashes than Billy’s,&mdash;“by the way,
dad, are you stopping?”</p>

<p>Bertram drew from his pocket a shilling, a threepenny
bit and a halfpenny:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis the very last shilling<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That with me would stay,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in a tenor voice of exceeding charm;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All its charming companions<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Have faded away&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“And therefore I have come to seek shelter beneath
your aunt’s roof; dwelling amidst so much luxury, she
will surely not begrudge me my cup of cold water,” and
he sipped appreciatively at the port wine.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And were she in the cauld blast<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My plaid should shelter her”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he warbled anew. “Not that she’s ever likely to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a cauld blast, old skinflint stick-by-the-fire!” in soft
parenthesis.</p>

<p>Peter said no more. Bertram, reduced to sudden
penury, had once before returned in this fashion, but
never yet with a wife. Miss Esther did not approve of
her brother-in-law. Miss Esther, bright and chirrupy
from an evening’s well-bred enjoyment, was now heard
in the front garden, thanking Mr. Lorrimer, an elderly
widower inclined to be attentive, for his kindness in
seeing her home:</p>

<p>“You won’t refuse to come in for a glass of something
and a sandwich? Nothing prepared, you know, nothing
prepared; just pleasantly informal,”&mdash;innocent of what
lay in store for her of pleasant informality.</p>

<p>Miss Esther was extremely short-sighted, and her
first impression of the three figures round the fire at the
far end of the room, was of Peter and her two young
friends, Merle and Stuart. Then her cordial expression
froze to antagonism, as advancing towards the male
outline, the blur of face shaped itself into the features of
her disreputable relative. Bertram, responding to
suggestion, became instantly the impudent scaramouch
she had always seen in him.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Essie! Pleased to see me? No&mdash;you’d
rather not be kissed? Just as you like. Chavvy, hither
and be introduced.”</p>

<p>Chavvy came shrinkingly forward. Miss Esther, not
daring to guess with what Bertram had here invaded
the sanctity of her home, bowed stiffly; and presented
Bertram to Mr. Lorrimer and Mr. Lorrimer’s daughter
Myrtle:</p>

<p>“My brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>“My wife,” said Bertram, explaining Chavvy.</p>

<p>Resulting in a fictitious assumption throughout
Thatch Lane, that Miss Worthing’s younger sister&mdash;not
a bit like her to look at&mdash;had turned up unexpectedly&mdash;“and
Esther doesn’t seem a bit pleased!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Such an odd little thing, my dear, almost not quite
a lady.”</p>

<p>Which rumour was to cause Miss Esther Worthing a
great deal of future annoyance. At present she had
only room for one supremely outraged sentiment: that
it was not county etiquette to cast your second wife
upon the bosom of your deceased first wife’s sister.</p>

<p>“Cook’s lying in a scarlet sleep under the kitchen
dresser,” Peter indiscreetly announced, having been in
quest of more glasses. “That’s why she didn’t open
to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, how very tiresome; I hope you hadn’t
to wait long.” Admirably the mistress of the house
rose to the occasion, to the traditions of caste, and to
the height of her linen collars. “But anybody who
knows anything about servants will know also what a
problem it is,” this to Chavvy, by way of a suitable
conversational opening. Peter, her aunt noticed with
satisfaction, was for the moment concentrating attention
on the Lorrimers.</p>

<p>Chavvy laughed with birdlike gaiety: “Why, I’ve
knocked about as long as I can remember in ‘digs.’;
and jolly well waited on myself, unless I could afford to
tip the slavey. You mustn’t ask me about servants.”</p>

<p>“Are you on the stage, Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;?” threw in
Myrtle Lorrimer. “How sweet! I once took part in a
Greek tableau, and wore sandals and filleted hair.”</p>

<p>“Sure you don’t mean filleted plaice?” interrupted
her father, whom Thatch Lane had encouraged as a
wit.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, father,” pettishly.</p>

<p>“And don’t you be pert, young lady.”</p>

<p>Bertram watched the pair closely and made a few
mental notes on the art of being a father, an accomplishment
wherein he was liable to grow rusty during his
long intervals of absence from Peter. Miss Esther was
still dutifully laughing at Mr. Lorrimer’s joke; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Chavvy, more at home now the talk had swung
nearer her zone of comprehension, replied eagerly to
Myrtle:</p>

<p>“Yes, just think, I played my first part when I was
only nine: Wally, in ‘Two little Vagabonds.’ And I
used to cry my heart out every night in the consumptive
bit at the end&mdash;have you seen it?&mdash;where he says:
‘Don’t forget Wally, who was your little son for ...
for a week!’”</p>

<p>“How sweet!” cried Myrtle Lorrimer again; “how
I should love to see you act!”</p>

<p>“I’ll act for you now, if you like.” Accustomed to
the society of touring pros, who would open the floodgates
of their genius at the slightest inducement, and
usually without, Chavvy placed a chair to represent
Sydney Carton; and, minus all preliminary hesitations,
treated the assembled company to scenes from the life
of Little Mimi, her most successful rôle.</p>

<p>... “Oh, Mr. Carton, if only you would not drink
so <span class="lock">much&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Bertram indifferently reached his hand for the
decanter. Peter, at that moment more niece of Worthing
than daughter of Kyndersley, squirmed uneasily at this
embarrassing exhibition of histrionics, and wished
Chavvy were a canary in a cage, that somebody might
throw a cloth to quench her.</p>

<p>... “I fear nothing while I hold your hand. I shall
fear nothing when I let it go....”</p>

<p>“Very nice,” said Miss Esther frigidly, “what an
excellent memory,” when Chavvy had slowly and with
drooping head mounted an imaginary guillotine, and
thus signified the performance at an end. Myrtle
clapped feebly. Her father muttered, “Ha&mdash;hum&mdash;yes,
Dickens. All very well in its proper place!” which
was emphatically with pages uncut upon an English
gentleman’s bookshelf. And Little Mimi, aware suddenly
that she was a stranger among the Philistines, fled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Bertram’s side, and, looking frightened, laid her cheek
against his hand.</p>

<p>Peter thought, “I’m sure somebody told her once
that she had eyes like a trapped fawn or a jugged hare
or something of that sort.” Chavvy’s appearance gave
rise to any amount of zoological speculation.</p>

<p>The Lorrimers rose to go. This type of entertainment
was not what they expected to find at Bloemfontein,
and they were quite unreasonably disappointed in Miss
Worthing. With lowered prestige, that lady returned
from the hall to her transfigured dining-room.</p>

<p>“Are you spending the night here, may I ask,
Bertram?”</p>

<p>“We are spending many nights here, Esther,” he
assured her gravely. And added in conversational
tone: “If you turn us out, we shall starve.”</p>

<p>Where was the man’s proper pride, Miss Esther
wondered disapprovingly. Well, well, she supposed it
was her duty to put them up for a day or two. One
couldn’t let people starve; it wasn’t done; and really,
that impossible little person in the red cap looked
nothing but skin and bone. Miss Esther offered to show
the bride to her room. And added a silent determination
to draw special attention to the cake of soap on the
washstand.</p>

<p>“Run along, Chavvy,” quoth Chavvy’s lord and
master.</p>

<p>She hung back and pouted. Then went slowly forward
to meet hostility, awaiting her at the threshold.</p>

<p>“Won’t you,” she faltered, “won’t you try to love
me just a little?”</p>

<p>Upon this she made her exit. The door closed behind
the twain, leaving Miss Esther’s reply to the imagination.</p>

<p>Peter crossed to the fireplace, lit a cigarette, and stood
looking down upon the man in the arm-chair. Noted
with pity that the topmost hairs of his head were thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>ning
considerably. Otherwise his florid good looks
seemed in no danger from the years. With a certain
shock of surprise, she realized how akin they were, he
and she; adventurers both, play-actors both; though,
lacking her burden of pride, his passage through the
world was even more divinely unhampered.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better tell me all about it?” she
suggested.</p>

<p>When Bertram’s reply came, it was still tinged with
borrowed reflections from Mr. Lorrimer, Parent.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a good deal by myself, my dear girl;
you don’t seem to realize what the loss of your poor
mother meant to me. And you, who might have been
a solace and a companion, you preferred to live here in
comfort and luxury. I was&mdash;lonely. And when this
child Chavvy crept into my life, I let her remain, to
fill the gap my daughter might have filled.”</p>

<p>Peter thought it over. “No,” she said at length,
very gently, “I don’t think that will do. Try again.”</p>

<p>The dark upward-springing moustache was not
sufficient to conceal a responsive grin on Bertram’s lips.
With considerable ease, he shed his garments of
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>“’Pon my word, Peter, I dunno exactly how it
happened.”</p>

<p>“Who and what is Chavvy?”</p>

<p>Chavvy, it transpired, was one of those people who
have no sober appellation, but answer to such names as
Kiddy or Babe or Rags or Little Pal, according to taste.
She was also alone in the world. “A weird child, yet
with something strangely attractive about her,” would
have been Chavvy as visualized by Chavvy. Garments,
whatever their previous origin, on her looked oddly
tattered. Fancifully she dwelt in a kingdom of dreams
and Pierrots and red, red roses and beating-rain-against-the-window-panes,&mdash;all
the paraphernalia appertaining
to quaintness. Actually she dwelt in the fourth or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
fifth or sixth stratum below normal level of the stage
profession; a tangle of veins spreading well beneath
the surface; unknown territory save to those who are
of it and in it and can never rise above it; underworld
of touring companies; fit-up companies; pantomime,
concert, and entertainment parties; sketches and
repertory and pageant. Comprising intimate acquaintance
with the smaller towns, the smaller theatres, the
smallest halls; of what audiences will take what type
of play and at what season. Underworld where each
member has an infallible instinct for ‘dates,’ for
‘something to be had,’ and good-naturedly pass the
word from one to the other. Where all names are
familiar: “I knew him three years ago in Nottingham;
we played together in ‘The Bells’”&mdash;drifting friendships,
drifting memories, drifting lives; yet all inseparably
woven together. London the improbable
El Dorado of impossible chances. A glamourless battered
underworld, yet from which none of their volition could
entirely sever themselves. An occasional one of its
members dropped to depths unmentioned and unquestioned;
or else was incongruously pitchforked into
spheres outside, as now Chavvy and Bertram.</p>

<p>They had met that summer at Blackpool; Chavvy
playing ‘Cigarette’ in a very makeshift version of
‘Under Two Flags’; Bertram warbling sentimental
ballads in the Masked Quartette of seaside singers. In
need of admiration and dalliance, as a burnt child needs
the fire, he found Chavvy interesting; alternately
teased and pitied her; and told her the story of his life,
the latter pastime a never-ending source of pleasure and
fount of imagination. Her brain stuffed up with
plaintive little Pierrot-poems, she found the man more
than interesting; and listened wide-eyed to the story
of his life, thinking the while how wonderful it was
that he should so obviously be in want of her, poor,
shabby....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“In fact,” said Peter, “she called you Pierrot, and
immediately you <em>were</em> Pierrot. There, O my father, you
have inherited my very worst tendencies. How did you
come to marry her?”</p>

<p>“Scoundrelly manager bunked, and left the whole
company in the lurch, with three weeks’ salary owing.
And she seemed to sort of cling to me. Masked Quartette
did rotten badly. We hung on till our united loose cash
was all spent, and then in extremity I bethought me of
Esther. I decided it would be quite nice if Chavvy and
I came to live with Esther. And I assumed the old
lady would prefer us to be married.”</p>

<p>“On the whole,” mused Peter, “I believe you
assumed correctly.”</p>

<p>“And so we fixed it up. And&mdash;and here we are.
Going to scold me?”</p>

<p>“Not as long as you guarantee my stepmother will
neither starve me, beat me, nor send me to gather firewood.
Come along, dad, we’re supposed to keep early
hours here.”</p>

<p>He pulled a grimace. “Can’t see myself sticking it
for long. I’ll run up to town to-morrow and see if
there’s anything doing in concert parties. I suppose
you can lend me my fare and a bit over?”</p>

<p>“As broke as that?”</p>

<p>“You can take it from me, my daughter,” turning
to face her, as they mounted the stairs, “that the
prodigal would not have returned for his fatted calf
while there was the least remnant of a husk left to him.”</p>

<p>&mdash;Miss Esther met them on the landing. “There is
the spare-room, Bertram; it adjoins mine, so please do
not chatter with your wife after half-past ten o’clock.
I will give you a face towel and a hand towel. Do not
use the bell-rope on any account. And breakfast is at
nine precisely,&mdash;we are very punctual people here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smaller">“WE TRAVEL LIGHT”</span></h3>


<p>Bertram was beginning to tire of Chavvy. Aunt
Esther was beginning to tire of Bertram. And
Mr. Lazarus, tailor, was quite obviously beginning
to tire of Peter and her persistent lack of response
to his demands for payment. Peter was just rather
tired. She could not pay Mr. Lazarus; and Chavvy
had conceived for her an unnecessarily clinging affection:
“After all,” she was wont to remark wistfully,
“we are girls together.”... Peter were not sure if it
were legitimate to girl with one’s stepmother. Furthermore,
her father and her aunt made her their headquarters
of separate complaint. And withal at any
moment might come a summons from Stuart, a letter
from Stuart, a challenge from Stuart, demanding that
she must be constantly and supremely on the alert.
For his siege of her was carried on in the spirit of
who would say: “Yield you shall&mdash;but yield if you
dare!”</p>

<p>At present he was following up a period of furious and
feverish need of her, when meeting after meeting failed to
quench the thirst that was upon them, by a prolonged
outburst of silence. An outburst in that it lacked all of
relaxation or flatness; insisted every moment of every
day that it was on both sides a silence pregnant of meaning&mdash;though
whether of self-torment or of defeat or of
bomb-manufacture neither could tell; a silence awaiting
hourly shatterment. Peter felt once or twice that
Stuart was mutely pleading with her to break it, or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
allow him to break it, but now it amused her to exact
mercilessly from him the quality of superman which
himself had thrust her into exacting.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you, my daughter.” In such
ponderous fashion did Bertram one Sunday’s noon, call
Peter aside into the trim quadrangle of garden. He
was addicted to airing his fatherhood in front of Miss
Esther and Chavvy, as though challenging them to go
and do likewise if they could,&mdash;“and it isn’t easy,”
disregarding a few minor facts of co-operation, “it isn’t
easy to have had a splendid girl like that, all by oneself,
and to have brought her up to be a credit!”</p>

<p>So now he laid emphasis on the appellation ‘my
daughter,’ causing Miss Esther to toss her head, as she
remarked: “Special afternoon Service at three o’clock,
Peter, my dear, should you feel inclined to come,”
signifying that she, more than Bertram, was responsible
for the girl’s welfare and up-bringing.</p>

<p>“Do you want me too, Pierrot?” pleaded Chavvy,
always alarmed at the prospect of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with her
husband’s sister-in-law.</p>

<p>“No,” snapped Pierrot; “stay where you are.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“I can’t make out,” he confided in Peter, as they
strolled towards the garden-seat, “why those two
don’t get on better; there’s a fuss every single time I
run up to town.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been up every single day,” she reminded
him gently. As, indeed, her pocket had good cause to
know.</p>

<p>Bertram, misliking her accents of reproof, remembered
his original intention in calling her aside:</p>

<p>“The&mdash;ah&mdash;young gentleman who seemed to occupy
a great deal of your attention, Peter; I’ve been making
enquiries, and he appears to be in a fairly sound position.
He hasn’t called here lately, I’ve noticed; I
hope,” with tender concern, “that he isn’t making a
fool of my little girl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter gazed helplessly at the speaker; then bubbled
over with joyous laughter.</p>

<p>“What would you do if that were the case, daddy,
dear?”</p>

<p>Bertram ignored both the question and the laughter.
“I should like to know,” he persisted, “what his intentions
may be?”</p>

<p>“As strictly dishonourable as even you could wish&mdash;Pierrot!”
mocked his undutiful child.</p>

<p>“Oh, damn!&mdash;Sorry, Peter; but do I look like a
Pierrot?”</p>

<p>“More like an organ-grinder; you’re disgracefully
shabby.”</p>

<p>“I know,” ruefully; “and my dress-suit is much too
tight, supposing I wore it in the mornings.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that Aunt Esther would approve of
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll run in to Lazarus to-morrow, and see if
he’ll rig me up a suit on spec.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lazarus,” murmured Peter, “has just got out
a summons against me. I wouldn’t go to Mr. Lazarus,
if I were you.”</p>

<p>“Lord!” Bertram exclaimed in genuine sympathy.
“I’m awfully sorry, Peter, old girl; I was just going
to ask you to lend me a fiver. I wonder if I could
borrow a ten-pound-note from anyone, and lend you a
fiver to pay Lazarus; then he might make me that
suit without pressing for payment, and I’d be five
pounds to the good.” He brightened considerably at
the prospect of five pounds to the good, and, jingling
the imaginary coins in his pocket, evidently considered
that he had now solved the financial problem with as
much ease as he had previously disposed of his daughter’s
love affairs. He turned to his own matrimonial aspects:
“Chavvy will be perfectly happy with you and Esther,
I suppose. The tour will only be for the rest of the
season.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“What tour?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you? I’m booked with the ‘Troubadours’
from the first of July; next Monday. A month
at Maidenhead, then a fortnight of Hastings, wind up
at Bournemouth. Got it through young Tommy
Weekes; he has cancer of the throat, and mayn’t sing
in the open,&mdash;or anywhere else, I should imagine, poor
Tom, except in the heavenly choir&mdash;and for that he
don’t sing the right kind of song. Being able to strum
on the mandoline settled it for me, and jolly thankful
I was, too.” He spoke quickly, feeling the impending
disapproval.</p>

<p>“You’re leaving Chavvy here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” defiantly.</p>

<p>“It’s hardly fair, dad; she’ll be miserable. ’Tisn’t
her sphere.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tour with a wife,” muttered Bertram.
“Where’s the fun, Peter? And she hangs round
me&mdash;oh, you’ve seen!”</p>

<p>True that Chavvy was of an ivy-like disposition.
And even a Pierrot will turn if sufficiently Pierretted
upon.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have stood this infernal tidiness a day
longer,” continued Bertram gaily, his momentary depression
lifted at the prospect of freedom. “’Pon my
word, Peter, I dunno how you’ve put up with it all
these years. I’d lift you out, if I could; take you along
with me. I wonder&mdash;perhaps you could hold a tambourine,
or something,” doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Peter, really grateful; “but I don’t
think I’ll do that, it’s too difficult. Besides, the tidiness
is only surface, and doesn’t worry me much. But it’s
a shame to leave Chavvy planted in the midst of it.”</p>

<p>“My dear, to her it’s the height of luxury, after all
the hardships she’s undergone; clean towels every
week, a bath every night, nice society, what more can
she want?” Bertram had not the faintest idea of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
illogical. And try as she would, Peter was unable to
detach herself from his point of view. It was, after all,
merely a repetition of Stuart’s creed, to cease sucking
when the orange was dry. But then, spoke justice, one
must not marry the orange.</p>

<p>A puff of wind which had been toying with some odd
scraps of paper on the lawn, now lifted the largest of
these and deposited it at Peter’s feet. She recognized a
fragment of the plaintive storyettes which Chavvy was
in the habit of scribbling, and afterwards, in the pride
of her heart, showing to Peter. So the girl felt no present
scruples in reading:</p>

<p>... “Who wear the white-and-black Moon Livery,
must sooner or later go forth to look for new loves. So
Pierrot went ... and Pierrette was very lonely&mdash;oh, very
lonely! Harlequin came to passionately woo her, and
many other suitors, but she sent them all away from
her quaint Little Red House, thinking that Pierrot would
return.... Pierrot did not return. The crimson rose
that he had dropped at her feet in leaving, withered, but
still she found sweetness in its Crushed Perfume.</p>

<p>“Autumn came and Autumn went....</p>

<p>“And Winter....</p>

<p>“Night after night Pierrette crouched in front of the
fire, waiting for the footsteps that never came; dreaming
into the ruddy hollows of the coals all her sad little
memories of the sunshine and carnival that Had Been.</p>

<p>“... One evening when the rain and hail and wind
shook the windows, Pierrette saw the petals of her rose
drop one by one to the ground, and gathering them into
her hand she cried impatiently that she too wouldn’t
wait any longer, and ran to cast the faded token of a
faded love on to the Rubbish-heap at the end of her
little garden of lilies.</p>

<p>“... Hark! a sound of sobbing through the darkness.
Across the Rubbish-heap lay a glimmer of white!
... ragged, wet, tired, Pierrot had crept home....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
And, forgiving all, she crouched down beside him, drew
his head into her lap.... ‘Pierrot,’ she whispered,
‘<em>I knew you would come back</em>.’...”</p>



<p class="tbpara">Thus far Peter was able to read. The author’s style
was well imbued with the Pierrot-germ just then rampant
in the air; yet here was sufficient at least to show
that Chavvy did not expect fidelity from her husband,
was preparing herself to be forlornly patient through
the long days of waiting. Peter chided herself as a
brute for the involuntary wish that Chavvy could go
and do it all somewhere else.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw Bertram and his wife as ludicrous
caricatures of herself and Stuart; he in his desire to
cut free whenever he pleased; and she&mdash;no, at all
events she would not wait for Stuart to come back to
her through wind and rain. Thirteen days now his
silence had endured; Peter cast an anxious look towards
the rubbish-heap round the corner of the house&mdash;and
at the same moment the gate clicked, and Stuart
sauntered towards them across the lawn; his appearance
so eminently matter-of-fact and prosperous as at
once to relieve her of alarm.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Peter. Come for a tramp?”</p>

<p>She departed to don thick boots. A ‘tramp’ with
Stuart, she knew from previous experience, meant that
whatever stood in their direct line of march, must simply
and without question be ignored. One did not go backwards
or roundabout or half-way. One went through and
on. If a mountain blocked the path, one went over it;
if a rushing torrent, then into it; if a board with “trespassers
will be prosecuted”&mdash;well, of course, that was as
good as an invitation; one had to consider if it were not
mere self-indulgence to follow the call. Time ceased to
exist; climatic conditions were just accepted; ultimate
destination remained a negligible quantity until one
established an ultimate destination by arriving there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and safety of limb was not for an instant weighed in
the balance against the possibility of surmounting an
eight-foot barrier interlaced with barbed wire, and an
enraged bull waiting on the further side. These little
country strolls with Stuart gave Peter an insight into
his religion of ignoring life itself in favour of life’s
lightest moment.</p>

<p>Therefore she donned thick boots and an unquestioning
spirit, wondering the while whether the first might
not be regarded as rather a contradiction to the second.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, left to entertain Stuart in the garden,
Bertram borrowed his ten pounds.</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax?</i>” said Peter tentatively, as they swung up
the road towards the Weald.</p>

<p>“Certainly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax</i>, or I shouldn’t have come.”</p>

<p>“You gave in first.”</p>

<p>“I did,” with quiet triumph; “you’d never have
given in, Peter; you’re a bit of a coward that way.”</p>

<p>“<em>I’m</em> a coward because I’d never have given in?”
cried the girl, who in the thirteen days’ interim had
almost forgotten how to tread in looking-glass land.</p>

<p>“Of course. I suddenly had enough of the fray,
wanted to see you, chucked over the entire edifice of
silence, and came. You’d have stuck to your guns, not
dared abandon them. Coward!”</p>

<p>She dashed back: “So you simply abstain from indulgence
as long as abstinence itself is the indulgence.
I always thought your asceticism was a distorted form
of vice.”</p>

<p>He laughed across the broad sun-slashed road, to
where she plodded in solitary anger.</p>

<p>“Won’t you join me in my ditch, Peter?” seductively;
“it’s a very nice ditch.”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“Peter. I did have to come. That’s rather a triumph
for you, isn’t it? I couldn’t keep away any longer.”</p>

<p>She stamped her foot: “I won’t have my sword re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>turned
to me in that fashion. And you know perfectly
well it wasn’t cowardice; that I can’t call you back,
ever, in case you might be gone for good.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” in blank astonishment,
“that if it were for good, you’d have let me walk out
in that casual fashion?”</p>

<p>“‘According to the letter of the bond,’” she quoted.</p>

<p>He kicked the sodden leaves with his heel; picked
up a stick and swished it at the air; burst forth at
length: “Hang it, Peter! I showed you the exit-door
once, and you’ve kept your eye glued to it ever since.
Forget it, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“It was an insult ever to point it out. Because there
was no need for it. I wouldn’t have tugged.”</p>

<p>“I know that&mdash;now,” his accents were almost humble;
“but you see, Peter, there have been other she-encounters,
and ... and they didn’t know about the
door. So I suppose I grew mistrustful.”</p>

<p>“Worse than that. You grew careful.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m sorry. Please, Peter, join me in my
ditch.”</p>

<p>So she laughed, and crossed the road to his side.
And a little further up the hill, they found a tinker in
the ditch, and tried to make him talk like the tinkers
of J. M. Synge and Jeffrey Farnol and Borrow and
Hilaire Belloc, and other welkinistic writers. But this
was Just a tinker; a man of no conversation and apparently
no philosophy. So in disgust they left him;
and, climbing a stile, struck out across the Weald, sweet
with the hot sweet smell of trodden fern; before them
in the East a threatening pall of cloud hung low and
grey over the landscape; and behind them, where they
could not see it, the sun flooded the same landscape in
slanting gold, which gave a curiously sinister effect to
the whole. Then a steep descent plunged them head
foremost into a labyrinth of bushes; netted undergrowth,
which they were compelled to butt through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
darkly, with snapping of twigs and branches to mark
each outward step; till at last, scratched and torn and
out of breath, they stood in the lane on the further side.</p>

<p>Stuart swung himself over a formidable gate which
barred the further end of the lane, and waited for Peter
to follow. After one or two attempts, she saw it was
beyond her accomplishment.</p>

<p>“I give it up, Stuart,&mdash;no, I’m hanged if I do!”
impetuously, meeting his quizzical look.... Then
drew back: “I’m not so afraid of you but that I can
own to being beaten,” she said.</p>

<p>He had remounted the gate in order to assist her,
and now paused to deliberate, a leg on either side the
topmost bar: “I wonder if I ought to make you do it,
after that.”</p>

<p>Gravely Peter waited, while he hovered on the verge
of a blunder.</p>

<p>“No!” and dropping to her side, he quietly raised
the wooden latch, and stood aside for her to pass through.</p>

<p>“If I’d noticed that it opened!” she laughed.
“Stuart, I’ve found your tombstone epitaph at last.”</p>

<p>“Which is?”</p>

<p>“‘He took the line of most resistance.’”</p>

<p>Stuart dwelt on her with a slow warm look, more of
man in it than he was wont to show. His hand rested
lightly upon her shoulder:</p>

<p>“Tired?”</p>

<p>She had never yet answered ‘yes’ to this query,
and wondered what mood it would arouse in him should
she do so. Supposing she <em>were</em> tired? tired of the
pilgrimage, of conflict, of the rain beating fresh and
cold upon her face....</p>

<p>A few yards ahead stood a little group, consisting of
a man, a woman, a perambulator, and two children.
The man wore a bowler hat, and the woman a fussy
dress of bright blue cloth, obviously reserved for Sunday
wear; one child was distinguished from the other by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
tippet of dirty imitation ermine. Otherwise they both
had sticky mouths, and both were complaining loudly.
The man lifted them in turn from the perambulator,
and dandled them: “Shall daddy wheel the pram then?”
and loud crows of assent.</p>

<p>Seen thus, the man in the bowler had the appearance
of one fettered to the texture of a dream, a dream whence
all the radiance had been soaked. In the wide spaces of
sky and land and rain, the whole turn-out had an inexpressibly
dingy look, that caused Stuart and Peter,
with an upward rush of spirits, to feel like Hermes and
Artemis walking the earth. He dropped his hand from
her shoulder, and side by side, untouching, they flashed
past the man and the woman and the two children and
the perambulator. And Stuart said again: “Tired,
Peter?” no longer wishing, as in the first instance,
that her answer might be ‘yes.’ “No,” she rang back
at him; and they smiled at one another, and swung on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Towards evening, an unexpected bend of the road
brought them home. It was Stuart’s habit to leave
Peter at the gate, without jarring by extraneous chatter
what they had found of magic in their day. But Miss
Esther, anxiously watching for them from beneath a
large umbrella, willed otherwise; insisted that Stuart
should not depart without his tea, “And you run
straight upstairs and get into some dry clothes, Peter,
my dear; Mr. Heron will excuse you.”</p>

<p>Rather glumly, Stuart followed his hostess into the
dining-room, where tea was informally spread upon the
big table. The prevailing atmosphere struck in him
the same note of drabness as had the incident of the
perambulator. Among these people he was regarded
as Peter’s ‘young man,’&mdash;well, not quite as bad as that;
Peter’s ‘admirer,’ who came to visit her on Sundays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and took her for a walk, and brought her home to tea,
<span class="lock">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Milk and sugar, Mr. Heron?”</p>

<p>“We used to sometimes squeeze lemon into tea, a
Russian boy and I,” volunteered Chavvy, who was
bravely hiding a heart that ached, Bertram having that
afternoon confessed his plans; “he had such melancholy
eyes, and his father was a convict,” attempting by this
recital to rouse her Pierrot to some sort of jealousy.
“They call it sayonara,” she added, in somewhat incorrect
explanation of the tea.</p>

<p>Miss Esther said that she had no patience with heathen
habits, and that everybody knew they were only imitations
of honest English tea-drinking, which was quite
good enough for her, thank you, without squeezing
‘sayonara’ into her cup. “Though I daresay you’ll
call me narrow-minded, Mr. Heron,” drawing Stuart
into the conversation, that he might not feel shy.</p>

<p>Animated by an Encyclopædic spirit very foreign to
his nature, Stuart explained drily the difference between
‘samovar’ and ‘sayonara’&mdash;“which happens to be
Japanese for ‘farewell.’”</p>

<p>“That’s just as bad,” pronounced Miss Esther.
While Chavvy murmured in timid apology for her
error: “I was thinking of Port Arthur,” and subsided
altogether.</p>

<p>Stuart looked up, relieved, at Peter’s entrance&mdash;then
bit his lip in annoyance. She had changed into a thin
crêpe frock; he felt sure it was her ‘best,’ donned for
his benefit. As a matter of fact, Peter’s garments had
been soaked through, and this particular dress was
quickest and easiest for her to fasten unaided; but,
thoroughly jarred by his surroundings, he chose to see
her too tainted by Suburbanism.</p>

<p>Miss Esther filled and refilled cups; sent Peter for
more hot water; maintained a flow of lofty but gracious
chatter, thinking privately the while that not often had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
she to entertain so leaden a tea-party; why, the Lorrimers’
Saturday tea-and-tennis institution held a
hundred times as much of innocent mirth. But, then,
Mr. Lorrimer himself was sufficient of a humorist to
make any party ‘go.’</p>

<p>Stuart she considered ‘difficult.’ All young men
were more or less so, but she had a method of taming
their barbarism never known to fail: on their second
introduction to Bloemfontein she would say carelessly:
“Now please remember that you can smoke all over
the house here&mdash;no forbidden ground,” and having
found the key to their mysterious masculinity, would
watch them in grateful enjoyment of their privilege:
“They appreciate it, poor fellows; of course at home
they’re never allowed it”&mdash;and: “You spoil them,
Esther,” usually the conclusion of these remarks.</p>

<p>But Stuart failed to respond to treatment. Notwithstanding
he had smoked a horrid black pipe up and down
the stairs and in Miss Esther’s own sitting-room&mdash;yet
here he sat morose and glum as any stranger, not a
patch in manners on that nice Mr. St. Quentin who
sometimes came.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was curious to observe how Miss Worthing’s
personality, the least arresting of any present, reduced
every other member to a polite and stricken level of
uncommunicativeness. Miss Esther, in her own setting,
and all her convictions securely buttoned in waterproof,
dominated Stuart and Bertram, Peter and Chavvy, to
the entire extinction of their own turbulence; so that
presently the two men were exchanging decorous views
on the political situation, while Peter and Chavvy, like
acolytes, supported Miss Esther with seed-cake and
bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>“If you have finished, Peter, you can take Mr. Heron
into the drawing-room. I told them to light a fire,
although this is the end of June, but then I always say be
warm when you are cold and never mind the time of year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The drawing-room fire was the outcome of a brief
skirmish which had once occurred between Peter and
her aunt, when the former had carelessly announced
her intention of taking Stuart up to her attic for the
viewing of some book.</p>

<p>“My dear, with your bed in it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll lead him very carefully past the bed,”
laughed Peter. “After all, it’s my den, as well as bedroom.”</p>

<p>Miss Esther stiffened: “Out of the question, Peter.
Even if you placed a screen around it&mdash;&mdash;” doubtfully.</p>

<p>Peter declared that the screen around the bed would
add the same suggestion of immorality that Venus
acquired by her fan.</p>

<p>So now Miss Esther emphasized warningly the drawing-room
fire.</p>

<p>Stuart pushed back his chair, and sauntered from the
room in Peter’s wake. He felt Chavvy’s eyes upon them,
dark and wistful&mdash;“you two will be together when I
shall be, oh, so alone,” the unspoken comment; and he
believed Bertram to be smiling complacently upon the
back of his son-in-law-to-be. And there he wronged
Bertram, who muttered: “I don’t like the fellow; too
damned superior!” and this in spite of the ten pounds.</p>

<p>Standing with his elbow on the drawing-room mantelpiece,
Stuart surveyed Peter moodily; she looked content
enough, content with the hideous prim room, with
the fire, the cushions at her back, the approval floating
up like incense from the dining-room below. And he
was seeing her in contact with homely familiar things;
had marked her press the bell for the maid to bring hot
water; heard her answer Miss Esther’s enquiries about
their walk&mdash;“Yes, thanks, very nice; where? oh,
just roundabout&mdash;&mdash;” Artemis linked to the trivial
details of everyday; Artemis at Bloemfontein; she
seemed leagues of distance away from him.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” queried Peter, lazily thrusting at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
silence between them. She too was secretly irritated:
why couldn’t he be restful, after their long wet tramp?
why always that atmosphere of tautness? Merle had
once said “Stuart has no firelight mood.”... For the
first time since their quarrel, Peter regretted Merle;
would gladly have had her there in place of Stuart,
“Just to volupp,” thinking of the cottage at Carn
Trewoofa, the rainfall, that last long dozing talk, broken
by the entrance of the two letters....</p>

<p>It was a pity, and rather absurd too, that she should
not have been able to keep Stuart and Merle.</p>

<p>&mdash;“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’m going, that’s all.”</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows in delicate scorn, but made no
further comment. Nor did she move when she heard
the door close behind him.</p>

<p>“He needn’t have been afraid,” with a finer appreciation
of his mood than he had given her credit for.</p>

<p>Miss Esther looked up sharply from her knitting, at
the rush of feet on the stairs outside, a slammed door, a
gate swinging wide on its hinges.</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Heron. And he has gone. How very
strange, without saying good-bye. And what is Peter
about, not to see him off? Dear me, foolish young people,
they must have quarrelled.”</p>

<p>“He will come back,” murmured Chavvy, in concordance
with her leitmotif.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Not yet, reflected Stuart rebelliously, as the train
bore him from Thatch Lane. Barely six weeks since
that night in Cornwall,&mdash;surely the shears need not yet
be employed. But having started at such extreme
tension, it was utterly impossible that their love should
be of long endurance. He had felt the first slackening
this evening; the first desire to be quit of her presence;
the first distaste at any of her actions. He must disengage
her from the background of orderly respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>ability;
search in his mind for the scene wherein he
would most desire to place her image; could not visualize
any sort of setting ... merely a scamper of wind, and
a voice&mdash;his own voice&mdash;saying authoritatively to someone:
“Get her out of irons, you ass! you must get a
way on before you turn her at the bank....”</p>

<p>That was it&mdash;exactly it! they had got their boat
into irons, he and Peter; must get a way on before
they rushed ahead or&mdash;turned at the bank. In either
case, get a way on.</p>

<p>He would take her sailing.</p>

<p>And casting about for a means of accomplishing his
wish in accordance with the conventions&mdash;Stuart was
not in favour of that ‘splendid unconventionality’
usually ending in a muddle, whereof Young Bohemia
delights to prate&mdash;he bethought him of Nigger Strachey.
Nigger had a wife, which just now would come in handy,
though Stuart had hitherto rather resented her entrapping
of his friend. It brought home to him strongly
the lurking danger that besets all men. Strachey had
been as sturdily opposed to marriage as Stuart himself;
and then, queerly, it had befallen him. So Stuart
walked warily, mistrustful of the crafty huntress who
hid in the dark, and then pounced. His fear of marriage
was the most unsubtle of all his qualities; an elementary
fear, of the kind that offers food for music-hall comedians,
and inspired Bernard Shaw to the writing of “Man and
Superman.” Peter knew of his fear, and hated it as
she might hate a gaoler, because it checked her
from spontaneously revealing all that she felt for
him.</p>

<p>The idea of taking Peter sailing utterly possessed
Stuart; and he went straight from Euston to Strachey’s
rooms in Chelsea.</p>

<p>“Look here, Nigger, have you still got that bungalow
at Potter Heigham?”</p>

<p>“The one you gave me for a wedding-present? Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Most unpractical gift I had. Looked to you for a nice
bit of Dresden, or at least a plated tea-service.”</p>

<p>“I want you and your wife to invite me up for a
week’s sailing; day after to-morrow; and bring whom
I like.”</p>

<p>“Do,” grunted Nigger; “delighted. Need we be
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Um!” Strachey removed the pipe from his mouth
and expressed his disturbance by a long and doubtful
whistle. “My wife&mdash;&mdash;” he began ponderously.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right.... What do you take me
for?”</p>

<p>“My mistake,” said Nigger, slowly masticating the
new aspect. Oliver Strachey’s mind matched his face,
in that it presented a great dark bulk occasionally
illuminated by a flash of white. His quick grin was as
unexpected as the rare streaks he displayed of wit or
humour; and his cumbersome: “I don’t quite follow
your meaning, Heron,” a great pleasure to his young
comrade, who liked to watch Nigger’s massive and
reliable mentality at work upon his own twisted acrobatics.
The two men were never confidential; never
gave mutual good advice; were ignorant each of the
other’s troubles; disagreed on all abstract topics; and
had thrice in company faced death by wave and wind.
All of which made for entirely satisfactory comradeship.
So that now Oliver asked no questions about the proposed
visit to Norfolk, and merely commented:</p>

<p>“Got stacks of work on hand. Still, I could do it in
Norfolk as well as here. What I’m wondering is if my
wife will care to go?”</p>

<p>“Hang your wife,” Stuart was about to say; then
recollected in time that men are absurdly prone to
touchiness on the subject of their domestic partners.
Especially when as doggedly in love as Oliver. It was
just as well to have restrained himself, as Aureole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Strachey just then came into the room. She walked
swayingly up to Stuart, and remarked in a heavy-lidded
voice:</p>

<p>“I dreamt that your uncle was dead. Is he?”</p>

<p>As an entrance, quite effective.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Stuart, surprised. “Which?
Baldwin?” hopefully.</p>

<p>Aureole did not know. But she was insistent about
the death. So to settle the matter one way or another,
Stuart telephoned home:</p>

<p>“Hullo ... that you, Mater?... Any of the
uncles dead?... No, you needn’t scream, darling&mdash;I
haven’t heard anything; just a passing curiosity....
Morbid? well, perhaps!... You saw them at
dinner. All quite healthy?... Good!” He rang
off, and reassured Aureole: “They’re not dead, any of
them.”</p>

<p>Aureole remained unconvinced. The soft full curves
of her mouth, resemblance of which she was vainly
trying to coax from a Greuze to a Rossetti, drooped
sulkily at the corners. She had no acquaintance with
Stuart Heron, save from her wedding-day, when she
had not much liked him. “He&mdash;gives me nothing,”
she had complained to her husband; “he&mdash;means
nothing.” And Nigger had made no reply, save by one
of his dazzlingly incongruous smiles, which all Aureole’s
provoked questionings could not compel him to explain.</p>

<p>But to-night there seemed a possibility that Stuart
would give her more. He scrutinized her intently for a
moment, from her copper hair, carelessly caught up
with a single jade hairpin, down to her temperamental
feet; and, inspired by these, shot out at her a
sudden:</p>

<p>“The pavements are stifling you. You should be
walking among reeds&mdash;always among reeds!”</p>

<p>Nigger had quitted the room in quest of tobacco; so
Aureole was able to blossom forth emotions which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
inexplicably to herself, she pruned when her husband
was by.</p>

<p>“Sand,” she breathed. “Miles and miles of shining
sand. Desert sand. I always adored walking on sand
at Broadstairs. Stretches of yellow sand as far as the
horizon. I’m a Pagan, you know!”</p>

<p>Stuart knew. He had gathered as much from her
first entrance. But sand was no good to him. He
wanted to arouse an all-consuming interest in reeds....
There were a great many reeds in Norfolk. For the
next ten minutes he plied her Paganism with such consummate
skill that she met her husband on his return
to the room, with the frantic request to be taken the
very next day to their bungalow on the Broads, or she
would assuredly perish&mdash;of paving-stones.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;just want to go. I can’t tell you why. Something
is calling me&mdash;something with a swish in it. I&mdash;just
want to go.”</p>

<p>So the expedition was definitely arranged for the
ensuing Tuesday; suspecting the ‘something with a
swish in it’ to have been Stuart, Oliver was yet somewhat
amazed that his capricious lady should choose to
quit town before the season’s shutters had closed down.
However, relations between them had been a little
strained during the past few weeks, owing to the effect
on her of a belated reading of the “Doll’s House,” in
conjunction with an occult acquaintance who had informed
her that she was the Empress Faustina reincarnated,
and must not be thwarted in aught she did,
since she was in this phase working out Karma. Not
keen on Karma, Oliver now hoped, manlike, that the
fresh air would make all the difference in the world
towards restoring marital harmony.</p>

<p>“The ‘Tyke’ in decent repair?”</p>

<p>“Believe so. I haven’t sailed since I’m married.”</p>

<p>Stuart’s grunt was expressive of many things.</p>

<p>“The ‘Tyke’?” cried Aureole. “What a horrid name!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
It shows how much imagination you men have, left to
yourselves,” in languid disdain.</p>

<p>Stuart promised her that she should re-christen the
boat. And after fixing the final arrangements, took
his leave.</p>

<p>“Even chances on ‘Tiger Queen’ or ‘Serpent o’
the Nile,’ I should imagine.” Thus he speculated on
the re-naming of the ‘Tyke,’ as he walked towards Grosvenor
Square.</p>

<p>But Aureole decided that night on ‘Faustina,’ in
deference to her own pleasingly lurid, though unfortunately
forgotten past.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He wrote to Peter: “Meet me Tuesday, Liverpool
Street, ten-fourteen. We’re out for a week’s sailing on
the Norfolk Broads. Never mind about the moralities;
I’ve arranged for those. Throw overboard other people’s
objections&mdash;and your own. Don’t wonder if you ought
to indulge me by giving in; we’ll have no battle here,&mdash;you’ve
just to come, and leave the rest to me. Bring as
little luggage as possible&mdash;we travel light.”</p>

<p>She replied briefly.</p>

<p>“All right”; and then in a postscript: “Were you
being symbolical about the luggage?”</p>

<p>To which his answer:</p>

<p>“You&mdash;dear! No, of course not. Damn symbolism!
I was thinking of porters.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smaller">WILD DUCK</span></h3>


<p>“Garden-party weather,” grumbled Stuart.
“S’pose they think they’re doing us a
favour; one doesn’t want a breeze for
sailing,&mdash;oh, no! Strawberries and cream and a band
on the lawn, that’s all the day’s fit for.”</p>

<p>Oliver lumbered indoors to work: “Call me when
the wind gets up.” And Peter announced her intention
of going out in the dinghy.</p>

<p>“Shall I come with you?” queried Stuart lazily, from
where he stretched on the grass at Aureole’s side.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Instantly he sprang to his feet and followed her down
to the bank, fell determination in his countenance.</p>

<p>“Go back, Stuart,” she whispered; “you can’t leave
Aureole alone; she’s our hostess.”</p>

<p>He protested: “Hang it! <em>I</em> gave her the bungalow.”</p>

<p>“Untie the rope!” Without heeding his complaints,
she sprang into the dinghy, where it floated beside
‘Faustina,’ née ‘Tyke’; and stood upright, scull in
hand, looking up at her comrade on the bank, with the
coolly indifferent air of being perfectly well able to dispense
with his companionship. Her white flannel shirt, flung
open to show the tanned throat; the clean line where
her hair sprang upwards from the neck; the alert poise
of her figure, seemed all to have gathered up and
expressed the personality of the background: water
quivering in the sunlight, dazzling white canvas of sails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
short bright green grass of the banks, masts and ropes
slicing and interslicing against a china-blue sky. Peter
resembled an adventurer setting forth in silence to find
the beginning of the world. Aureole, exotically reclining
with hands clasped behind her head, had more the
appearance of one who had found the end of the world
and was prepared to talk about it. Stuart flung her a
discontented look over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Is this a morning to waste with an amateur cocotte
telling me she’s a Pagan?” he demanded, still holding
in the dinghy.</p>

<p>Peter merely laughed, and, with an adroit movement,
pushed away into midstream.</p>

<p>As Stuart walked slowly back to his hostess, he knew
there was nothing he wanted so much as to be alone
with Peter on the Broads. Certainly he had gone to a
vast deal of trouble in bringing hither Mr. and Mrs.
Strachey, for the sake of the proprieties. He was prepared
to go to an equal amount of trouble in ridding
himself of them. Nor would the charge of inconsistency
have disturbed him a whit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aureole had been deriving a quantity of
fresh ideas from the contemplation of Stuart and Peter,
and their treatment one of the other. She had never
before seen love in conflict, and it struck her as attractive.
An attempt to engage Oliver in a similarly
slippery and perplexing wrestle of wills merely sufficed
to augment his loving consideration; when Aureole was
capricious, then Aureole had to be humoured, was the
burden of his thoughts. From considering him a tyrant,
a bully, and a gaoler, which was her last attitude but
one, she veered round to the belief that she had married
a poor-spirited creature. The germ within her, born of
Nora Helmer’s rebellion, was feeding nicely and growing
healthily plump, the past three days in Norfolk.</p>

<p>Aureole broke silence with a sudden: “Mr. Heron,
do you think I’m happy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied Stuart guardedly. And waited for
more.</p>

<p>“<em>She</em> is!” Aureole let her eyes follow the disappearing
craft that contained Peter. Then: “A man
takes you for granted when you are once married to
him. He pampers your body and neglects your soul.”</p>

<p>Stuart said: “You mean he pampers your soul as
well as your body. A soul needs no pampering; it wants
fresh air, and an occasional touch of the whip.” And he
added musingly: “I’m a Pagan, you see!”</p>

<p>She made bitter reply: “Oliver is&mdash;just a man.
That’s the difference.”</p>

<p>She had a way of half dropping her eyelids, and, after
a pregnant silence, shooting forth an unexpected
audacity, calculated to shatter the well-bred restraints
of convention to a thousand fragments. Stuart had
caught the trick, and found himself unable to refrain
from using it upon her now:</p>

<p>“Why not ... leave him?”</p>

<p>And for a while no sound but the scream and plash of
a water-fowl on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>“Have you read Ibsen?” queried Stuart with
disconcerting acuteness&mdash;considering that he had seen
her for three days past with the “Doll’s House” in her
hand.</p>

<p>Aureole murmured: “She went out to find herself
and to earn his respect....” No need of a superfluity
of words when talking to this man; his grasp at her
meanings was almost uncanny. And she thought with
distaste of Oliver’s “I&mdash;don’t&mdash;quite&mdash;follow,” whenever
she let fall a subtlety. Nor did it ever occur to her
that Nigger Strachey, who had taken a first at Oxford,
was perfectly capable of following her to any lengths
that were worth his while, and merely made her explain
her special type of profundity in the faint hope that
thus she would attain to a sense of what it lacked.</p>

<p>Aureole’s soft lips were mysteriously smiling; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
she merely said in light tones: “You are a bad
counsellor, Mr. Heron. Why don’t you persuade me to
obey my husband and be content with my lot?”</p>

<p>“Not much fun in that, is there?” he replied; and
would have enlarged further on the stuntorian point of
view which lay in breaking away from a husband
because he refused to contradict you. But remembering
Aureole lived three twists further down the corkscrew
than himself, he substituted a reflective: “I wouldn’t
mind being present at the scene when you came together
again.”</p>

<p>Her eyes, large and velvety brown as pansies, began to
sparkle. “So you anticipate a stormy reconciliation, do
you?”</p>

<p>Stuart said with a graveness that rebuked her
flippancy: “Do you love him so little as to remain
always apart?”</p>

<p>She drooped her head; truth to say, she was exceedingly
fond of her stolid square-backed husband.
“If I returned to <span class="lock">him&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“You’d have achieved your purpose then. Nigger
needs a volcanic eruption before he would realize anything,
least of all you. But once the knowledge came
to him, he’d need an earthquake to dislodge it again.
His mind isn’t elastic, you see. It’s for you to provide
the eruption. If you don’t&mdash;&mdash;” Stuart paused to
extract matches and cigarette from his pocket.</p>

<p>“If I don’t?&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you don’t, I’ve no doubt your husband
will continue faithful and <span class="lock">attached&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” Aureole dug her shapely heel&mdash;too high for
sailing purposes&mdash;deep into the grass.</p>

<p>“And will keep you nicely sheltered from draughts”&mdash;he
had struck his match; the flame wavered and went
out. Again he attempted the process, with the same
result.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord!” with sudden buoyancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Wind!” And loudly summoning Oliver from the
house, Stuart strode towards the boat.</p>

<p>Aureole could have wished the wind to have waited.
She was preparing to announce in her most irrelevant
manner: “Do you know ... when I touch a kitten,
I suddenly feel as if I must kill it. Crush it to death.
Just because it’s small and soft, and I love it.” This
could not fail to be productive of interesting discussion
about primitive feelings; and how we are really all
savages at heart; and the things that cause us separately
to feel most savage at heart. But you cannot
shout forth statements of this description to a man who
is climbing to the masthead, unfurling sails, swearing at
ropes, and generally disporting himself in a thoroughly
joyous and normal fashion.</p>

<p>The three set sail, and picked up Peter swishing her
dinghy between armies of tall reeds. She came aboard,
and under Stuart’s curt directions, sailed ‘Faustina’ in
a light breeze, as far as the bridge. The feel of the tiller
she had thoroughly grasped by now, but was still
dependent on superior orders for manipulation of the
mainsail. She resented the necessity for blind obedience;
resented the inexperience standing between her
and initiative; wished passionately to be master of
that insolent canvas which now swelled adoring response
to the lordship of wind.</p>

<p>At first, the Broads had merely impressed her with
their utter absence of fuss. Wide waters, and blue skies
pulled down to meet their edges; here and there an
upspringing windmill; landscape dropping flatly away
below the water level; a merry impression, arising from
the frequent bends and twists of the stream, that ships
can go a-sailing across field and meadow; racing clouds
and racing shadows; music of bottles that rolled and
clinked in the locker; sound of rushes whispering
uneasily; scurry and plunge of a water-rat; an over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>whelming
interest developed in the wind, its character
and vagaries, to the exclusion of all intellectual pursuits;
the urgent necessity to use strong language, and to wear
as little as possible, and drink yellow ale stabbed by the
sunshine, and sleep anywhere, and eat everywhere,&mdash;these
then were the essentials of Sailing. These; and
concealed within and beyond these, the hidden gift,
which Peter knew could not be hers until she had torn
away the veils of ignorance that kept her from mastery
of that exasperating expanse of white canvas. Except
the necessary technicalities, Stuart had told her nothing.
She must grope until she found. Meanwhile, she steered
them into the putty....</p>

<p>“What the Hell are you doing?” with a lusty roar,
Stuart leapt Aureole, shoved Peter to one side, seized
tiller and sheet, and just saved the keel from running
aground. Then sunnily, and with no recollection of
the expletive that had passed his lips, he relinquished
his post, and asked for cigarettes.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing I admire more,” murmured Peter,
intensely amused; “than a truly manly man.”</p>

<p>Stuart did not hear. His major portion was inside
the locker. But Aureole did. And she thought she had
rarely witnessed aught so fine as this virile comradeship
between man and girl.</p>

<p>“Nigger! cigarettes!”</p>

<p>A mere voice from before the mast, where he squatted
and smoked with the imperturbability of a Buddha,
Oliver replied: “In the locker.”</p>

<p>“Where d’you think I’ve been the last ten minutes?
There’s nothing in the locker but matches.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” acquiesced the voice. “Heard a
legend that people who sail always forget matches.
Destroyed the legend.”</p>

<p>“You have, with forty-eight boxes of wax vestas,
and not a single tin of Gold-Flake among ’em. You’ve
got your pipe all right, I suppose?” with fine sarcasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks. Yes.”</p>

<p>“I say, Mrs. Strachey, do you mind feeling for a
cigarette-tin under your feet, along the lee-scuppers?”</p>

<p>After long and obliging search, Aureole produced the
pressed-beef, whereof Stuart, resigning himself to
circumstances, proceeded heartily to eat.</p>

<p>“What is to be, must be. Not so close to the wind,
Peter; that’s better, that’s a jolly useful luff”; the
result of a lucky guess on the part of the pilot. “All
the same, you’d better resign the helm to Nigger; lot of
shallows just about here.”</p>

<p>They were drawing near the spreading waterways of
the Sounds. Oliver took Peter’s place. The wind was
still exasperatingly light, needing experience to extract
from it all the possible pace. Oliver seemed uneasy.
Presently he suggested anchoring for lunch.</p>

<p>Peter enquired: “Do we sail over the edge or into
the hayfield?” the latter extending low on their right,
so that it really seemed as if they could sail straight on
and in among the haycocks; while on their other side
sky and water closed sharply together, with beyond
them a drop over the very edge of the world.</p>

<p>They chose the hayfield, as being more homely and
conducive to good appetite; moored the ‘Faustina’
fore and aft; and recalled Aureole from her rapt contemplations
of nature: “‘And O! That greener
green, that bluer blue!’”</p>

<p>Her brown eyes were very dewy, and her throat was
infinitely whiter than Peter’s; she was all sinuous
curves and melting harmonies of tint. And very good
to look at, Stuart reflected,&mdash;if only she wouldn’t
describe the scenery!</p>

<p>“By the way, Nigger, are you aware that you’ve
been sailing on the wrong jibe?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t want to knock out my wife’s brains.”</p>

<p>Aureole looked up sharply: “You could have told
me to move, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“You looked very comfortable, my dear.”</p>

<p>A hot spurt of anger flushed Aureole’s creaminess.
“If Peter had been in the way of a jibe,” she said in a
carefully controlled voice, “Mr. Heron would have&mdash;sworn
at her. He has sworn at her twice to-day.”</p>

<p>“Heron’s not a gentleman,” decreed his friend, with
unusual promptness of speech.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but he’s at least a man.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked embarrassed. And Oliver became
dimly aware that his wife was really enraged with
him.</p>

<p>“Diddums, spitfire?” tentatively.</p>

<p>She burst forth: “You can’t treat me in the spirit of
equality, of give-and-take. No! I’m a petted little
soft thing, who mustn’t be inconvenienced or she’ll cry;
so you’re chivalrous, and sail on the wrong jibe, and&mdash;and
think yourself a fine fellow. You don’t understand,
do you, that there’s nothing, no, nothing on earth I want
so much as to be properly sworn at!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he apologized for not having sufficiently
damned her. As a result of a moment’s consideration,
he remarked placidly: “Blast you, Aureole,
pass the mustard,” with an air of having thus fulfilled
all that was required of him.</p>

<p>Aureole did not pass the mustard. But said very
quietly, in tones eloquent of suppressed meaning:
“You will discover that it is not always wise to play
the fool, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>!”... and an echo from a far-away
world of shams and introspections and problem plays,
mingled strangely with the impatient music overhead;
for the wind, with the perversity of winds, had elected
to blow fresh and hard from the instant they moored
the boat; and like the crack of whips was the sound
of the sail flapping against restraint.</p>

<p>“Wild-duck paste, Mrs. Strachey?” demanded
Stuart, scattering her preoccupation.</p>

<p>If Oliver had apprehended a tithe of what lay beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
her reply, he would not have continued hammering so
contentedly at the glass tongue.</p>

<p>“Wild duck.... Yes, indeed I will have wild
duck.”</p>

<p>“‘Crosse and Blackwell’s Wild Duck,’” Stuart read
from the tin in passing it. “It has a pathetic tone, as
if it were their pet, their only wild duck; the one that
Crosse caught in the grounds with a butterfly net, and
Blackwell pounded into paste, and Crosse wept and said
he never loved a dear gazelle to glad him with its soft
black <span class="lock">eye&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Stuart was talking hectically; there was a look in
Aureole’s soft brown eye, meditating upon the nebulous-tinted
mess smeared upon her bread, that positively
alarmed him. “I don’t mind symbolism as a rule; but
when it comes to symbolism in potted <span class="lock">paste&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Aureole smiled all the way home; a smile beside
which Mona Lisa’s celebrated grimace paled to inanity.
But the two men, beating in a foul wind and against the
tide, had no time to spare from ‘Faustina,’ who was
certainly behaving a great deal more like a Tyke than
a lady.</p>

<p>On arrival at the bungalow, Aureole announced that
she had run short of stores, and must walk down to the
village before she could provide them with supper.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, dear.”</p>

<p>“I prefer to go alone.”</p>

<p>Oliver shrugged his shoulders, and without further
ado, sat down to write letters.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours’ labour, he looked at the time.
Then he called aloud his wife’s name. Then he searched
the bungalow. Finally, he strode to the foot of the
lawn; in the well of the boat, a curve of obstinate back
denoted that Stuart, since their return home, had been
absorbed by a trifling defect of leakage, while Peter
reluctantly held a candle to him.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to you, Heron?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“One moment,” in smothered tones.</p>

<p>Oliver waited ten, patiently. Then Peter said,
“Come up, Stuart!” and blew out the candle. Whereat,
dirty and tousled, he arose from the depths, and was
exceeding wrathful.</p>

<p>“What did you want to do that for?”</p>

<p>“Your pal asked to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“My wife’s gone,” explained Oliver in bewildered
tones.</p>

<p>And Stuart sat down suddenly and exclaimed:
“Good Lord! Wild Duck!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t&mdash;quite&mdash;follow,” uttered in Oliver’s most
phlegmatic manner. Stuart’s reception of his tidings
struck him as neither respectful nor efficient.</p>

<p>“How long has she been gone?” queried Peter
practically. “She went down to the village, I thought.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Village seven minutes’ distance. She went
at twenty to six. Now it’s past eight. I don’t suppose
for an instant,” continued Oliver, “that she proposes
to stop away longer than a few hours, for the purpose
of annoying me; I believe I wasn’t in favour,” with a
slight smile. “She has played this kind of trick before.
High spirits, that’s all. But it’s getting dark, and I
wondered whether we hadn’t better go out with
lanterns.”</p>

<p>“Lanterns, indeed! I tell you, Strachey, it’s the
Wild Duck. Don’t look at me in that&mdash;that bovine
fashion. Has she taken your pistols?”</p>

<p>“Why should she?” helplessly.</p>

<p>“Wild Duck!” chanted Stuart with monotonous
reiteration.</p>

<p>The sun had long since been blotted greyly from the
west. Pennons of ragged mist fluttered wraithlike about
the fading banks; waved and drifted and dissolved in
streamers over the colourless tracts of water. The
blasphemous mumblings of an ancient and invisible
fisherman rose and fell in cadences upon the uncanny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
silence. An hour before, and the reeds had still been
tipped with the sun’s gold. An hour later, and blackness
would be warm and velvety, interrupted by chirps
and rustlings, stir among the rushes, and the brush of
unseen wings. But at this between-hour, phantoms
were abroad; and melancholy stole over the souls of
Peter and Oliver; melancholy deepened by Stuart’s
strange repetition of ‘Wild Duck! Wild Duck!’
term which now held a gloom and menace it had
altogether lacked at lunch that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll explain your reference, Stuart?”</p>

<p>“Ibsen&mdash;and the Doll’s House&mdash;when Nora went out
to find her soul. You refused to swear at her this afternoon,
and I thought something bad would come of it.
And then the wild duck put it into her head to take
your pistols and go to sacrifice something ... with
vine-leaves in her hair.&mdash;No, that’s Hedda Gabler!
Oh, well, there’s an impossible husband in that, too!”</p>

<p>‘Pistols’ were even more sinister than wild ducks.
Oliver said, “You imply that my wife has committed
suicide?”</p>

<p>They could not clearly see his face in the half-light.
Stuart leapt in with a hasty and matter-of-fact “Of
course not. Don’t be absurd. She thinks you need&mdash;oh,
startling into a keener realization of her personality,
and this is her way of doing it.”</p>

<p>“But you said she hadn’t merely gone for a walk?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You mean, I shall never see her again?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;” exasperated. “Can’t you get something
between a mere walk and never-again?”</p>

<p>Oliver couldn’t. The weight of his opinion had
crashed heavily from one extreme to the other; as
Stuart had remarked, he was at all times difficult to
move, either forwards or backwards.</p>

<p>“If she’s not coming back,” argued Oliver, “she
must have left me for good. And if she has firearms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with her, then I’d better follow. It all looks to me very
silly.” And with a commendable absence of flurry, his
broad back loomed up the garden, and disappeared
into the bungalow.</p>

<p>“Peter,” whispered Stuart, when they were alone;
“haven’t you yet discovered the secret of the Broads?”</p>

<p>She was an instant silent, as if listening for a reply to
his question. Then it flashed across her in the phrase
of his letter.</p>

<p>“We travel light.”</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;we travel light. All luggage too heavy
for the rack, to be thrown on to the rails.”</p>

<p>“Are you speaking symbolically?”</p>

<p>He said, “No, of course not. Damn symbolism!...
I’m speaking of Aureole and Oliver.”</p>

<p>The latter emerged from the bungalow, and called out
something about ‘London.’ Stuart walked quickly to
meet him:</p>

<p>“Look here, old man, she may lie low for a week or
two, but believe me, there’s no earthly reason for you to
get feverish about it.” And then the notion of Strachey
being feverish struck him as inexpressibly comic.</p>

<p>“I’m not. But I’m catching the eight-forty-one to
town. She has probably gone home. I don’t care to
think of her messing about with revolvers, even to
impress me.”</p>

<p>The pistol idea had established itself firmly; Stuart
saw that it was hopeless to attempt removing it before
the eight-forty-one started.</p>

<p>“Good-bye.” Oliver had evidently forgotten about
Peter.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” and Stuart returned to the boat.</p>

<p>“I like Nigger Strachey,” Peter decided, squatting
on the rail of the ‘Faustina.’ “Stuart, how far are
you concerned in this affair?”</p>

<p>He defended himself hotly, immensely fortified and
upheld by the moral consciousness of being in the wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fancy accusing me of being directly responsible for
the whim of a neurotic woman.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. Now tell me how you are indirectly
responsible&mdash;oh, it’s no good, my lad! That rigmarole
of ducks and pistols gave you away&mdash;to me, at least.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my usual style, I admit,” laughed Stuart.
And owned to the morning’s conversation with Aureole,
when he had spurred rebellion into action. “It won’t
do either of ’em any harm, you know; prevent ’em
from getting sluggish. Any sort of stir to matrimony;&mdash;why,”
with fierce indignation, “they might even have
come to think themselves happy, if I hadn’t shown
them they weren’t.”</p>

<p>“Philanthropist,” softly from the girl beside him in
the dimness.</p>

<p>“All the same, I wonder where she can have gone, and
what she has done; plenty of spirit there, and character
too, if only she weren’t such a wild&mdash;goose!”</p>

<p>“Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>Stuart leaned against the boom and faced her
squarely.</p>

<p>“I could pretend it’s too late to catch the eight-forty-one,”
he said. “Or you could pretend not to know
that it’s breaking rules to remain up here alone with me.
But we won’t pretend, either of us. The situation is not
accidental&mdash;they were in the way, and I got rid of them.
I wanted one day of sailing by ourselves, that’s all.”</p>

<p>He went on, “We can take ‘Faustina’ up as far as
the ‘Windmill,’ put up there for the night, and leave for
London to-morrow evening,&mdash;or we’ll catch the eight-forty-one
now. There’s still time.”</p>

<p>She repeated musingly, “We won’t <span class="lock">pretend&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“No. You can trust me, Peter. It’s just for the
sailing. But other people, if they get to know, won’t
believe that. It’s a question of how much other people
are to count?”</p>

<p>Peter sprang from her perch into the well, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to untie the cords which held together the waterproof
covering of the mainsail. He laid his hand over her
moving fingers, and looked at her interrogatively. She
laughed, mocking his sudden solemnity:</p>

<p>“You see ... I’m a Pagan!&mdash;oh, it’s all right,
Stuart; we’ll take another day on the Broads, in spite
of other people. Who was it counselled me to travel
light?”</p>

<p>He smiled. But merely said, as he re-tied the knot
her impetuosity had loosened, “No wind; and the
stream against us. I shall have to row.”</p>

<p>Peter took the tiller. Some twenty minutes later,
between the plash and lift of his oars, her ear caught the
distant shriek of a train-whistle. And she knew the
eight-forty-one to London had just left the station.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">THE WORLD WASHED CLEAN</span></h3>


<p>Peter awoke, and, listening intently, heard
nothing beyond a faint lapping of water. Yet
she felt impelled to leave her bed and scramble
up to the high narrow window-seat. She had no idea
of the time, but it must have been very early morning;
the breeze was chill and aloof that struck upon her
throat, as she leant out, an intruder upon silence.</p>

<p>A white vapour lay lightly as forgetfulness over river
and bank and boathouse. On the opposite shore, a
tangle of masts and ropes lay sketched like a dream
upon a blown and tousled sky. A luminous gash in the
east widened suddenly, and silvered all the mist; then
closed again with cloud. The very river ceased its
patient clamour for the sea; and colour had died in the
night, leaving its wraith of grey to tell the tale. Grey
that shone, and grey that was thin and dreary, and grey
that pearled and paled to white. Peter had a strange
fancy that she would not have been suffered as an on-looker
had not her own eyes held their depth of grey,
and her hair a whisper of the baulked sunrise. It was
her day: she mused on what it might be trailing in its
reluctant wake. Her day, grey and white and pallor of
gold. And she wondered why all of her life that went
before should be mist-shrouded in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Her eyelids drooped heavily; she returned to bed,
and at once fell asleep.</p>

<p>Stuart awoke her by hammering blows upon her
door. She went again to the window before she opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to him. A bright blue sky now; trim red roof of boathouse
and ferryhouse and bungalow, warm in the clear
sunshine; screaming, cackling, chattering chorus of
waterfowl; a sail, left hoisted overnight, flung its
broken dance upon the water, sparkling and rioting
between its clumps of emerald-green reeds. The world
washed clean of mystery and evil alike. Peter slid open
her door a few inches.</p>

<p>“Hallo! you’re in full rig.”</p>

<p>“Rather. I say, this is a ripping house, all its clocks
have stopped, and I’ve left my watch down at the
bungalow, so we’ll never know what time it is. Good
morning, Peter.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Stuart; I want some cherries.”</p>

<p>“While you dress?”</p>

<p>“While I dress.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, I don’t think the greengrocer has
called.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find a bagful of white-hearts in the locker
of the boat.”</p>

<p>He brought them to her; firm hard cherries, cold
and fresh to the lips as the dew stabbing its little balls
of light from every grass-blade. Presently she joined
him in the hall; a grandfather clock groaned three
sepulchral strokes as she descended the wooden stairway.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it,” Stuart warned her; “just hold
tight to the fact that before last night was yesterday,
and after next night will be to-morrow; no more is
necessary. Come for a walk.”</p>

<p>They rattled back the heavy door-bolts, and wandered
for what seemed a long space of time along unfamiliar
paths and across drenching grass, without meeting anything
more awake to its responsibilities than a slowly
creaking windmill. Then returned to the inn. Still no
movement of life. The door stood ajar as they had left
it. The hands of the grandfather clock were dallying
eccentrically in the regions of half-past eleven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is getting serious,” Stuart complained, rousing
terrific thunders upon the gong. “Where is the traditional
tiller of the soil? Where is the buxom hostess
astir before cockcrow? Where, principally, is cockcrow?”</p>

<p>“The cocks of the neighbourhood have been warned
that a superhuman crower of crows has come to dwell
among them. Therefore they are silent and abashed.”</p>

<p>“I’d be ashamed, if I were a cock, not to put up a
little competition. All hail! here’s what was once a
waiter!”</p>

<p>The half-dressed, yawning apparition that, mop and
bucket in hand, uprose from the lower regions, stared
aghast at the mention of breakfast; muttered “Not
for an hour or two, anyways”; and began without
enthusiasm to sweep the dining-room.</p>

<p>“We’d better go for another walk,” suggested Peter;
“something tells me we have got up too early.”</p>

<p>Lying in a burning field of rye and poppies, he held
her hands, and said: “It seems the most natural of all
things that we should be here together and alone.”</p>

<p>“I know,” disappointedly. “I don’t feel a bit as
wicked as I should. But you <em>do</em> think I’m bold and
bad, don’t you, Stuart?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re just most awfully bold and bad,”
heartily.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and&mdash;of course I can’t expect you to feel the
same respect for me as before,” wistfully seeking reassurance.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, naturally, a fellow never looks on a
girl quite like before, after&mdash;I mean, well&mdash;there’s
always something gone, isn’t there? I mean, a fellow
wouldn’t like his sister to meet a girl who&mdash;hang it,
Peter, you know quite well what I mean!”</p>

<p>Then he laughed, and moved closer, among the stiff
yellow stalks broken by their intrusion. “It’s tremendously
all right, isn’t it, dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” she confessed. “I’ve been waiting
all the time for the sudden misgiving that tells me I
should not have stayed. But it hasn’t come.”</p>

<p>Stuart sympathized over the nuisance of an essential
mood missing. “It spoils the set, and one can’t play
demon patience any longer, and&mdash;come home to breakfast!”
suddenly springing up. His nerves, though the
girl was not aware of it, had been playing demon
patience on their own all through the night, and were
in consequence rather jumpy.</p>

<p>By dint of sitting like two mutes in the dining-room,
and looking steadily reproachful while the waiter continued
to sweep it out, they at last goaded him into
serving them with breakfast.</p>

<p>“And now,” striding across the garden towards
‘Faustina,’ “now we’ll get under way. A long day,
and a strong day, and a day spent together.” Stuart
broke into rollicking song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The sail’s aloft, the wind’s awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The anchor streams the bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stays are trim, the guns are grim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Captain, where art thou?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was late afternoon when the wind, for the first
time since their stay in Norfolk, really found itself;
and Peter became of a sudden definitely aware of
Sailing. Beating up Bure to Acles, the sheet fairly
taut in her one hand and the tiller somewhat restive in
the other, she grew to joy in the swish of the reeds
against the bows, as she swung the boat round, and let
the boom lurch over; in the jerk of the rope, as she
controlled its rattling passage through the blocks, with
already her eye straining forward for the crucial moment
at the further bank. She did not notice, in this new
intoxication of pace and mastery, that Stuart had
ceased to give directions ... when suddenly, gripped
by a strong puff of wind, the sail leapt sideways, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
water sang up over the lee rail; and Peter, taken by
surprise, would have been hurled to the floor of the
boat, had she not just in time flung up her heels and
braced them against the opposite scuppers; nor did
she let go of the sheet, which tore like some live thing
at her palms.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Stuart calmly. “Blowing up a bit
fresh. Shall I take her?”</p>

<p>“No.” And now she understood sailing right enough:
this thing which demanded of her every atom and
particle of strength she possessed, and some she did not
consciously possess until that time. A darkness crept
across the sky, and the wind’s whistle had an ominous
note. More and more the boat heeled to meet its own
disappearing shadow; till it seemed as if one could not
for an instant longer retain that tilted position in the
lifting scuppers.</p>

<p>&mdash;“We’ve got to beat it,” cried Stuart; “don’t let
’em get to windward of you!” And then only she saw
that they were being furiously raced by another craft,
with larger canvas than their own, and a shouting crew
of men. Stuart was excited&mdash;a race always brought
out all the child in him.</p>

<p>“You can make the next corner if you’re careful,
and then she’ll run!”</p>

<p>The ‘Tyke,’ emphatically now the ‘Tyke’ and not
‘Faustina,’ did indeed luff the corner, and scudded ahead
straight and clean with the galloping motion of a greyhound.
Peter’s blood was romping; her hand felt as
though cut in two where sawn by the rope; shoulders
and knees and wrists, no part of her that did not throb
and ache and cry aloud for release from this straining
torture&mdash;torture that she would not have forgone for a
lifetime of ease and pettiness and mild enjoyment. For
she was conquering the wind, and gaining on the other
boat, and never before had water been so near or the
world so far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“We ought to reef, but we won’t!” Stuart’s voice
sang in triumphantly with the roar and whip of the
waves. “More sheet, Peter, or she’ll carry away. Not
much&mdash;no, none at all, and chance it! By Heaven,
it’s great!”</p>

<p>Peter’s entire soul and body were bracing themselves
in resistance against the push of the tiller. Her teeth
fastened firmly into her lower lip. She had not known
one could so hate an inanimate bar. Inanimate?
possessed rather of seven kicking devils.... And then
she saw the bridge ahead; and Stuart announced with
gentle pleasure: “We’ve won,” and slipped into her
place, and turned the ‘Tyke’ downstream. The defeated
crew called out a hearty word of appreciation; Peter
smiled at them; lit a cigarette; and, soaked by the
churned-up spray, her hands stiff and bleeding, subsided
on to the floor of their vessel, whereof she watched
in passive admiration Stuart’s perfect handling.</p>

<p>“I now propose,” he said, “that we should feast our
victory while under way, which in itself is a battle of
some stubbornness. In other words, Peter, you shall
collect what there is of lunch from among the tarpaulins
and suit-cases littering this most disorderly tub, and
minister to my needs while I cling to my post at the
wheel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“An’ I never left my post, sir, for the cappen ’e bid me stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ me ’ands were frozen an’ cut, sir, an’ me face was stiff wi’ the spray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But me thirteen children are dead, sir&mdash;an’ there’s nobody left to care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I stayed, like Casabianca, on the fighting ‘Téméraire’!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was no easy matter, with the deck tilted at an
angle of 30°, to find the requisite bread and meat and
ale, plates and forks and bottles. It struck Peter that
sunset was a curious hour for lunch; as still more
curious that the sun should set at all on this day which
had begun so long ago. It was a lurid and tempestuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
sky, jagged across by untidy streaks of black, the whole
swimming canopy overhead as it were being sucked and
drawn by red relentless fingers into the very heart of
the western turmoil.</p>

<p>“Stuart, there’s no glass.”</p>

<p>“Must be.”</p>

<p>“<em>Isn’t</em>,” crossly.</p>

<p>“A tin mug, then?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but a flower-pot&mdash;will that do? Why do
you keep flower-pots on board? Is it that you may
grow nasturtiums while becalmed?”</p>

<p>“A flower-pot will hold the beer all right, if you keep
your thumb in the hole at the bottom, all the while I
drink.”</p>

<p>Peter refused. “I’m not your squaw.” And Stuart
related with reproachful emphasis the story of the
little boy in Holland who had not minded plugging a
hole with his thumb all through the weary night, to
save his country from inundation. Nevertheless, Peter
was not incited to emulation.</p>

<p>All this while they were running before a powerful
wind, sail and water ablaze with crimson, the same red
glow splashing their faces and their hands, and touching
with magic all the level shores. A bottle was hurled
into the scuppers, crashed into fragments; and triumphantly
the breeze hummed through the straining cordage.</p>

<p>It struck Peter that sunset was a good time for lunch.</p>

<p>“Hullo! here are the mortal remains of the wild-duck
paste.” And they both laughed, thinking of the
immortal remains, bearing fruit in Aureole’s heart.</p>

<p>“Not that I think wild ducks do bear fruit as a rule;
too reminiscent of a hen laying a melon. Peter, unless
you are playing at Tantalus, or rather the gods who
tantalized Tantalus, you might hold the bread a few
inches nearer my lips.”</p>

<p>Passing St. Bennetts, the wind dropped somewhat,
the clouds piled themselves out of sight, and the sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
paled to a lake of clear light green wherein the round
red ball of the sun hung motionless, striped by
the darkening reeds.</p>

<p>Stuart hailed a cabin-boat with seven men on board,
all lustily singing.</p>

<p>“Hi! what’s the time?&mdash;excuse me, Peter, but it
had to be done.”</p>

<p>“Half-past six,” they wove their reply into the
strains of ‘John Peel.’</p>

<p>“We shall make it, easily, and with half an hour to
spare, wind or no wind.”</p>

<p>Peter looked enquiring.</p>

<p>“The eight-forty-one. You wanted to get home
to-night, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>All day long a glittering mist had lain lightly as
forgetfulness on speech and memory. The reminder
dropped mournfully as a premonition. The sun sank
yet lower, staining the very roots of the tall green
spears fringeing the waters. And the boatload ahead
ceased from their jovial ditty, gripped by the conventional
melancholy of evening.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” prophesied Peter; “they’ll sing&mdash;what
do you bet, Stuart? I say: ‘Swanee River.’”</p>

<p>She was very near the mark in her guess. As the last
ruddy segment dipped under the horizon, a haunting
haunted melody floated backwards upon the sighing day:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Look out, for the Goblin Man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ragtime Goblin Man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run, run, just as fast as you can....”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“The darlings!” murmured Peter. “They’ll repeat
it eight times, and then the ass of the party will start
for the ninth time, and John will tell him to shut up.”</p>

<p>John was a Voice from the Cabin, and evidently the
strong man of the party, as one could hear him being
constantly consulted, in tones both supplicating and
respectful.</p>

<p>But the plaintive tune, drawn out thinner and ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
thinner as the larger boat drew away, was working
potent havoc upon Peter’s carefully guarded Marshes of
Cheap Sentiment. Noting this, Stuart summoned her
to the helm: “Come and take her. We shall probably
jibe round the next bend,” and buried his head in the
locker.</p>

<p>Peter wondered rather irritably if he did this on
purpose whenever a jibe loomed ahead. She had no
affection for the jibe. It held for her an agonizing
moment, after she had hauled in the sheet, when she
became a blank as to which way the tiller should be
rammed, in squaring the sail anew. Up till now,
Heaven had been with her, but this time Heaven
looked unpropitious&mdash;perhaps because the sun had set.</p>

<p>Heaven elected at the critical moment to send her a
strong gust of wind, the last they had in stock that day.
It spun the boom crashing to leeward, before Peter had
time to do anything at all. Followed a delirious instant
when it struck her she ought to manipulate the tiller&mdash;and
did it, with dire effect. She was aware that Stuart
had come out of the locker, that the water was rushing
up from behind to meet her, and that the boat was
evilly tilting her downwards to meet the water with an
evident after-intention of turning turtle over her drowning
body. She did not call to Stuart, even then, instinctively
certain that he was doing something useful in
emergencies, and might be trusted to save her afterwards.
All this in the space of time it takes a boat to
turn over upon its side and drift at right angles to the
river, the sail sagging flatly upon the surface of the
stream. An invisible weight to balance Peter’s, was
obviously preventing ‘Faustina’ from accomplishing a
complete somersault.... Stuart had scrambled like
lightning over the rail and flung himself upon the keel.
Then he looked around for Peter, and was relieved to
find her clinging with both hands to the opposite side of
their improvised see-saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you hang on?” he queried cheerfully.</p>

<p>She replied in like tones, “How long?”&mdash;and suppressed
her inner doubts.</p>

<p>“Till we float ashore. I can’t do anything while I’m
on the keel, and mustn’t move off it. How much of
you is immersed?”</p>

<p>“Up to the knees.”</p>

<p>The boat hovered about uncertainly in midstream.
There was no one in sight, and no sound but the breeze
shivering the rushes. A fish leapt shining from the
water, and plunged again into a circle of ripples. From
round the next bend still drifted snatches of the ‘Ragtime
Goblin Man’; evidently John had not yet spoken.
Some distance over the land, yet not so far but that
they should distinctly have heard the throb and clangour,
a train passed in a linked blur of lights; passed noiselessly,
like a phantom train. Peter, watching it, wished
passionately that she might hear it whistle, as reassurance
that she herself was real, and not a pictured
castaway upon a badly drawn bit of wreckage.</p>

<p>At last they floated into a mud-bank; and were able
thence to wade ashore.</p>

<p>Peter waited for Stuart to display extreme anxiety
as to her degree of wetness, to burst into pæans of
praise on her bravery and calmness in the face of danger,
and finally to mutter with white young jaws, “I shall
never forgive myself&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>Stuart said curtly: “Shivery? No? That’s all
right; d’you feel equal to giving me a hand with the
sail? We must lug it up somehow,”&mdash;happily convinced
that by thus increasing the wind to the shorn
lamb, he was treating the lamb in the spirit it most desired.</p>

<p>And as they tugged and hauled in the dim light at
that most obstinate of all foes, a water-logged sail,
Peter played up gallantly to his call upon that other
Peter; the one she had carefully cut according to his
measurements. Round her lips hovered a rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
tremulous smile at the manner in which she was thus
for a second time required to pay for her audacity in
playing at God.</p>

<p>&mdash;And yet, was it payment, after all? With a little
thrill of exultant surprise, Peter realized that the Peter
of her disguises could not be a mere lay figure, since she
had not discarded them in actual moment of peril and
when thrown completely off her guard. Why then,
they had become in very truth a part of her being;
she was indeed Stuart’s Portrait-of-a-Lady, complete
in all its essentials; she had stood the test....</p>

<p>There was far more actual fun to be had from standing
ankle-deep in mud, with a spectral wind flapping
her wet skirt against her knees, while she pitted her
strength viciously against a tangle of wet rope, than
from the use of her feminine privileges&mdash;Was there?...
The old Peter hollowed into the mist a momentary
fancy of a warm glowing interior&mdash;soft colours&mdash;soft
cushions&mdash;warmth and ease and the dry slippery touch
of silk upon her flesh&mdash;the abandoning of all effort to
the stronger male who realized and joyed in her greater
fragility....</p>

<p>“Peter, I want you! Hold this”&mdash;Stuart’s voice,
confident and imperative. And the mist curled itself
greyly over her pictured fancy of chintz and rugs and
warming-pans, of sentiment beside red caves of firelight,
and withal of a lover who was not a leprechaun.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Coming!” for a while they worked grimly,
neither speaking.</p>

<p>Stuart paused in his labours, threw a tarpaulin on
the bank, seated himself thereon, and invited Peter to
do likewise. Then, in a sudden access of chivalry, he
wrapped around her his own oilskins, thereby giving her
more than ever the appearance of a battered stowaway,
and consented for a moment to dwell on their quondam
peril. Nay, he even came to her to be fed, in an engaging
manner all his own:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was a long way from the locker to the keel,”
reminiscently.</p>

<p>She said not a word.</p>

<p>“I was fairly quick, I think. Didn’t fumble, did I?”</p>

<p>Still no reply.</p>

<p>“Peter,” imploringly.</p>

<p>Then she gave in, and was bad for him: “You were
magnificent, Stuart.”</p>

<p>His crow was fervent but subdued. The atmosphere
not being conducive to any sound above a whisper.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll just bale out the tub, set it on its hind
legs, hoist sail, and be off. She didn’t ship much water;
dryest capsize I’ve ever done. A beautiful capsize,
really; Peter, I’m glad we capsized; it will have a
pleasant look, viewed from to-day a year hence.”</p>

<p>“Pleasant, but passing strange,” she murmured,
gazing on the gaunt ribbed outline of their marooned
vessel. “‘It was the Schooner “Hesperus,” that all
on the shore lay wrecked&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“‘The skipper’s daughter had hold of the tiller. So
what could you expect?’” finished Stuart.</p>

<p>She surveyed him reproachfully. “Is that&mdash;generous?”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to be generous?&mdash;Good Lord,”
with sudden heat, “do you think I’d pay any other
girl on earth the compliment of not fussing round her
wet feet ... especially when I so much want to,” he
added under his breath. Then returned quickly to his
labours on the boat.</p>

<p>Peter was glad that she had not hearkened to the
insistent pratings of the other Peter. Glad that Stuart
guessed nothing of their existence.... The pictured
fire-red interior had acquired a sudden cheapness,
viewed in the light of his last speech. Her face burnt
at the idea that he should ever know that these easy
longings had even for a moment found their entrance.
After all, and undoubtedly, this, her present plight, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
far more fun; though she was cold beyond all hope of
warmth, and tired past all desire for rest,&mdash;far more
fun ... lean restless ways of fun that he had taught
her; strange, slippery ways as the way to the moon,
and as unprofitable.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Peter! Quick&mdash;here!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smaller">THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE ORANGE</span></h3>


<p>It was not long before the well had been baled, the
gaff run up, and a very wet mainsail flapped in
mournful abandon against the mast. Then
Stuart pushed off with the quant-pole, while Peter
curled herself among the regions of his feet; from the
general ooziness she suspected she was sitting in about
two inches of water, but by now it seemed more natural
to be wet than dry, and she made no efforts towards the
latter state. The mists brushed her cheek with clammy
fingers; naught of clothing but was damp and cumbersome
to the body; the water had insinuated itself into
matches and cigarettes, had gurgled into the locker, and
soaked into the comestibles. Water-logged, they crept
on and on with the tide through the murky twilight, a
faint saffron stain in the west betokening where once had
rioted the banners of the setting sun. From time to
time a light flashed warmly from a house-boat on the
banks, or cheery but muffled voices told of sails being
laboriously tucked away for the night, masts lowered,
clinking crockery washed up for a late meal. Theirs was
the only vessel still adrift. Huddled in her big cloak,
Peter watched the darkness eating up either shore, while
the river took on unfamiliar curves and windings, seemed
to branch off into two&mdash;ten rivers, all beckoning
different ways. And once she called out sharply, “Look
ahead!” that Stuart should swing the ‘Tyke’ clear of a
gigantic looming ship, three tiers of sails, and a ghostly
figurehead. “Why?” And he steered straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
through the ship with its three tiers of sails. Peter said
no more, not quite trusting what further tricks her
sight might choose to play. She crouched still further
into the well, content to see naught but the edge of
sail against the dense pall of sky, and dimly, where
Stuart sat, an outline of bare neck and slouched hat and
lean nervous hand upon the tiller. It all went to make
perfection: the timeless blue day spent in big spaces,
limbs stiff from their perilous tussle, and now the sodden
boat, and the shadows, and Stuart beside her. She put
out a chill hand to feel if he were indeed solid substance;
touched his knee, felt him start and tingle&mdash;she could
not see the hot rush of blood into his face.</p>

<p>Suddenly he swerved the bows towards a forest of pale
reeds; they bent apart to the sliding passage of the
boat, then closed up in its wake. The keel ran aground.
Stuart let drop the mainsheet; it rattled lazily along
its blocks, and was still. The sail drooped forward, fell
back again.</p>

<p>... She lay suffocated in a darkness of kisses, that
stole her breath away, and her powers of resistance;
robbed her of all knowledge save of desire beating itself
out upon her lips and her throat and her eyes; upon the
lids she drooped for evasion, upon the hands she put up
to protect her, upon the hair she tumbled forward, and
upon her neck when she turned her head. And then
again fiercely upon her mouth, compelling her to be
passive, compelling her to response. And through the
pain and through her weariness, sang a strain of rejoicing
that he should treat her thus; that their brains and
their mockery and their intellect should yet have been
all blotted to naught in a whirling storm of passion.</p>

<p>... He had drawn a little away. She raised herself;
pushed back her hair with the bewildered gesture of a
child. Her throat ached as if someone had attempted
to strangle her, and her mouth felt stung and bruised.
Then Stuart bent towards her, took her in his arms:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
“Lie still, dear” ... and for the first time Peter lay
still; mind and body and soul, still.</p>

<p>It was over, the endless strain of winning and keeping
the man; the endless effort of playing-up. He loved
her with a great finality of love. She could&mdash;lie still.</p>



<p class="tbpara">A shaft of blackness pierced light. And Peter became
aware that this very moment which had brought her
belief in the endurance of his love, was the moment long
foretold when they must consent to end it. Love’s
consummation&mdash;both had agreed that nothing less must
follow.</p>

<p>Did Stuart know?... And suddenly his hands
slackened completely their hold on her&mdash;then tightened
again to an almost intolerable grip. He too had realized
the door of exit.</p>

<p>But it was absurd, for an elusive unproven theory, to
renounce a thing at its perfection; Peter had doubted
always if she would be big enough for that. And now
love had proven so much bigger than she had anticipated.</p>

<p>She would risk the descent on the further side.
Though the Hairpin Vision shone full and steady as
limelight upon the future, she was yet willing to take all
the hazard of lessening love, so she might keep love.
Keep it in whatsoever form he wished, free or bound.
Stuart would not employ the shears alone, without her
co-operation. If she willed, she might use the moment
to entangle him with a thousand threads, beyond all
hope of breaking away. Why shouldn’t she? Since he
had made her need of him so great, he must pay his
share. And of what avail to set aside the temptation,
since then he would never know it had existed?</p>

<p>With a great stirring of anger, Peter looked up at him.
His face was turned away, still set in desire, but now not
for her. It was the supremest desire of a man whose
star had granted him his every wish; desire for re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>nunciation.
Young Fortunatus pursuing the winds of
sorrow.</p>

<p>Her anger waned and died to tenderness. This was not
the ruthless orange-sucker of her first imaginings. She
alone knew how rigidly and untiringly his asceticism
had striven to keep its leanness against that terrible
perversity of ease which threatened to engulf him. And
she could help him. By her and because of her had
actually come his chance of a sacrifice worth while&mdash;oh,
yes, she understood; and she could, if she chose, be
sufficiently big to allow it him. Came a rush of pride
like a sonorous North-Easter humming through the
shrouds: No other girl could have kept up with him
as far&mdash;she was not going to fail at the last ... he had
once called her a genius of life.</p>

<p>His eyes met hers, a question in them. And she
laughed. “We’ve had a good run before the wind,
Stuart.” Heard the triumphant fling of his reply, “And
we’re not going aground in the putty now.”</p>

<p>He unlinked his arms; took up the quant-pole;
pushed back to mid-stream. Within a few minutes they
were at the landing-stage; a sharp walk brought them
to the station platform: Eight thirty-six&mdash;and the train
left at eight forty-eight. “Not bad,” remarked Stuart;
“considering our day of uncounted hours.”</p>

<p>There was just time for Peter to send off a wire to her
cousins in Turnham Green, bidding them reserve her
a room that night; she would arrive in London too late
for the further journey to Thatch Lane. Then, with a
shaking roar, the train plunged into the station, barely
waited to gulp its few passengers, and thundered southwards.
Peter found that her fellow-travellers regarded
her with astonished eyes, and departed to view herself.
The results of sun and wind, of immersement in the
water, and those few after-moments among the reeds,
exceeded her wildest expectations. It took half an hour’s
unsteady labour before looking-glass and washstand-basin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
before she might lay the least claim to respectability.
She was relieved to find, however, that her
flaming cheeks and lit eyes and lips dark as wine were
not at all reminiscent of the girl about to be forsaken
by her lover. She was tremendously exultant that her
body should have stood the strain of the day, as her
soul had stood its close. And she had never walked so
lightly as up the crowded dining-car to rejoin Stuart at
its far end.</p>

<p>“Metamorphosis?”</p>

<p>“Only from the waist upwards,” she displayed her
boots, still caked with a large portion of Bure’s shores.</p>

<p>They were both in brilliant form, bandying their
shafts to and fro over that jolted meal. Liverpool Street
came as a shock. They continued to jest in the taxi
which bore them with uncanny rapidity to the boarding-house
in Merton Crescent. The chauffeur mistook the
number; halted with a jerk several houses before the
squat complacent little red-brick building where Peter
was to pass the night. They alighted, and Stuart paid
and dismissed the man. They waited, listening, as if it
were of importance that not a throb of the vanishing
wheels should elude their concentration. Then in
silence they walked up to the iron gate of number
seventy-four, stood stock-still facing one another. There
was a sickly dazzle of light behind the Venetian blinds
of the window level with the street; somebody was
watching them through the chinks. Not that it mattered
in the slightest degree. Peter’s head was tilted well up,
and she was smiling. Far away, that old discarded
Peter clung tightly to her lover, pleaded with him not to
go; Peter eyed the shadow in contempt&mdash;she had no
more use for it.</p>

<p>“We won’t meet again.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>As they had planned it, without lingering or reproach.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to kiss you,” said Stuart. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
even touch her; yet she winced and braced herself
beneath his look as she had done perforce when his
actual grip had tightened.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Hullo!”</p>

<p>The front door of the house was suddenly flung wide
open, and Peter’s flapper cousin Jinny, flanked by a
whole bevy of young people, flocked through the
aperture, bore down upon her with boisterous greeting.
And now steps and doorway and silent street were
a-swarm with marionette-shapes, whose shrill cries and
exclamations drowned the beat of Stuart’s retreating
steps....</p>

<p>Peter was hauled indoors&mdash;she could almost hear her
face click as she adjusted it to the suddenly altered
conditions.</p>

<p>“Come along in, do; we’re kicking up no end of a
shindy! I say, won’t your friend join as well?”</p>

<p>And then the red-plush drawing-room, with red-plush
music tinkling from a cheap piano, and air thick
with gas and seed-cake, and Cousin Constance, Jinny’s
mother, saying with interpolation of stuffy and affectionate
kisses: “These young folk are behaving disgracefully,
my dear; but there, it’s Saturday evening, and I
hope you ain’t too tired to join them.”</p>

<p>On Peter’s other side, a frivolous girl of thirty-six
waggled a plump forefinger, “I saw you saying good-bye
to your young man! I believe you must have
quarrelled&mdash;he didn’t even kiss you good night.”</p>

<p>Next, she was introduced to the mild gentleman whom
she had met there before&mdash;“So don’t you pretend to be
hoity-toity, Miss Peter,”&mdash;and to the irresistibly
humorous Tommy Cox, whom she hadn’t met there
before, and who said straight away, “Now tell me this,
if you can: could you make a Maltese Cross?”&mdash;and to
Luke Johnson, the boy from next door,&mdash;while the
landlady, who was also a friend of Cousin Constance,
kept up a running fire of questions connected somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
with coffee: “Some people like it better with milk, and
some people like it without; some people take two
lumps of sugar, and some like one, so all you’ve got to
do, Peter, dear, is to tell me how you like it best. Some
people....” The saga began all over again.</p>

<p>It seemed to Peter that this final necessity for playing-up
was rather in the nature of an extra on the bill. But
that strange new part of her for which Stuart was
responsible, could not cease abruptly with his exit, but
went on a little while mechanically rotating in obedience
to the hand that had set it in motion. So she skilfully
dodged her cousin’s kisses; accepted the thick cup of
muddy lukewarm coffee; answered the riddle about
the Maltese Cross; gaily averred that she was not a
bit tired, and quite ready for “high jinks”; and
allowed herself to be drawn into a rowdy game of
musical chairs.</p>

<p>Crushing memory below the surface, she sprang to the
head of the scuffling line awaiting the music’s signal to
<span class="lock">start&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You made me love you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I didn’t want to do it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I didn’t want to do it,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>round and round the empty line of chairs&mdash;then a cry,
and a mix-up, and shouts of “He’s out!” A chair
removed from the row. The music started once more.</p>

<p>Only eight combatants left&mdash;seven&mdash;six&mdash;Peter could
not contrive to get left out; a chair seemed ever ready
to embrace her, as the jovial pianist ceased from play.
She felt the urgent need of sleep leaking noiselessly into
her being. Her limbs refused any more to obey the
call upon them. Almost she abandoned the struggle,
beat an ignominious retreat in the middle of the game.
An echo of Stuart spurred her on as with whips: “It’s
a glorious stunt, Peter! don’t give in before the end.”&mdash;Yes,
but need she listen, since he was not to count any
more? Willy-nilly, his training outlasted him; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
made a forward dash for a seat, this time out of reach,
determined she would be in at the death, as a votive
offering to the lord of all stunts, great and small.</p>

<p>And now there were only three jigging round to the
endless tune.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And all the time you knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I guess you always knew it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You made me&mdash;&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Silence, then a noisy outburst from the spectators lining
the walls: “You’re out, Miss Tomkyns! his lap don’t
count as a seat, you know.” Giggling, Miss Tomkyns
withdrew from the contest. Remained Peter and the
objectionable Tommy.</p>

<p>“Now then, Peter, beat him. It’s up to you&mdash;show
old Tommy what girls are made of!” Jinny literally
danced with excitement. And Cousin Constance at the
piano started once more to strum, with the evident
intention of prolonging the agony.</p>

<p>Ah! that renewal of the chorus was too vigorous to be
genuine. The end was at hand. Peter, on the back side
of the chair, turned suddenly and faced Tommy, who
was so amazed at this change of tactics that he facetiously
flung out one leg after another along the ground,
Russian-ballet fashion. At this juncture, as anticipated,
the tune halted abruptly in the middle of a bar&mdash;and
with a slight movement Peter had occupied her throne
before he could recover his balance.</p>

<p>And she smiled, a provocative ‘there-you-are’ smile,
not intended for her clapping enthusiastic spectators.</p>

<p>“Bravo, Peter! you’re a sport! Shame, Tommy, to
be beaten by a girl!”</p>

<p>“And now to bed, every man Jack of you,” cried Mrs.
Thorpe, who since five minutes had been listening with
dread to the impatient tip-tap on the ceiling, of a best-bedroom
boarder afflicted with insomnia.</p>

<p>“She cheated, twisting round like that, instead of
goin’ straight on,” grumbled Tommy, in the hall. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a great many humorous gentlemen, he could not take a
beating.</p>

<p>And Peter turned on the stairs to remark tauntingly,
“There, there, Master Tommy, never mind. We’ll say
that you won, shall we?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you pay for that, young lady!” Only
half in earnest, but stung nevertheless by the laughter
of his friends, he made a rush for his tormentor. She
broke away from him, ran with dangerous swiftness to
the room she usually occupied. She could hear Tommy
panting at her heels; his breath, stale with cheap
tobacco, on the back of her neck. “Go it, Tommy
boy!” urged his companions from below. Peter
clenched her hands; ‘pay for that’&mdash;she had a very
clear idea how the Tommies of this world exact payment.
She would <em>not</em> be kissed to-night, not ...
again.</p>

<p>Putting on a spurt, she gained her room, crashed the
door in his face, and turned the key in the lock. Tommy
called through one or two witticisms, and strolled away
to be consoled by his pals. Then Jinny knocked a final
‘good night’ and did Peter want anything? Peter
wanted nothing. So Jinny too departed. A whispered
exchange of banter on the landings; a loud guffaw; a
flurry of feet.... Silence now in the house. Peter’s
day was over, grey and white and pallor of gold. It had
been a very long day. She was logged with sleep, as a
water-logged boat that can no longer crawl for heaviness.
Eyelids tumbling, fingers purely mechanical. Nothing
was remembered, nothing existed save her longing for
bed. Bed was a tangible thing and mattered very much.
She was just aware, through formless drifting clouds
whirling her mind to stupor, that it was just as well she
should be physically so dead beat.</p>

<p>Light turned out, and head plunged among the
pillows. It was sand that was weighing her down;
heavy yellow sand; she could hear it trickling into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
crevices and chinks and joints of her body; hear it like
water among the reeds ... hear herself falling asleep.</p>

<p>And knew that before dawn she would awake, purged
of her merciful weariness. Wake to the knowledge of a
world without Stuart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smaller">FORTUNATUS</span></h3>


<p>If Stuart had been a poor man, and forced to continue
drudgery whatever his troubles of love, he
would have wrested a certain comfort from the
obligatory effort. But placed as he was, it would have
been mere childishness to deceive himself with an assumption
that he was not perfectly free to absent himself
from Holborn for as long a period as he pleased. Derwent
had taken a needed holiday in May, directly following
the prick of Gobert’s balloon, and was now back again
at his post. Baldwin ran up most days from Sonning,
except when solemnities of regatta nailed him to the
spot. Business was at its slackest; and Stuart could
no more persuade himself that he was morally necessary,
than that his attendance was compulsory.</p>

<p>In no mood for make-believe, beset by a bitter craving
for what he had denied himself, by a still more bitter
doubt as to whether his had not been a fool’s action,
he set out for the Haven, where he could at least be sure
of solitude while he fought the matter through.</p>

<p>The Haven is marked somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Poole. Actually, it is in the neighbourhood of
nowhere. A man walks into the Haven perhaps at set
of sun, finding it always a little beyond the point where
he is desirous the walk be ended, so that he walks into
the Haven tired and with lagging step. On one side of
him the sea shines a ghostly grey; not breaking in waves,
nor tossing in a glitter of foam, nor making any sound
whatever; but flowing, flowing, in slantwise ripples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
towards the land. And when he is accustomed to the
sight of it on his one side, he is gradually aware of a
stealthy lapping on his other side, beyond the sand-banks
sown with coarse grass. There also is the sea,
flowing in slantwise ripples towards the land, so that he
loses all sense of east or west. For his further confusion,
either horizon is bestrewn with hazy tongues of land,
floating strips of island; and on either horizon, tumbling
silent seas lick their way among the nebulous shores.
The sun dips red and round, and the moon rises round
and red; so that for an instant of bewilderment the sun
might be the moon and the moon might be the sun;
and both sun and moon hang loosely, midway between
sky and ocean, having no link with either. The only
thing permanent is an old hulk embedded in the stretches
of flat white sand; and thither the traveller is impelled
to climb; for the sand has an untrodden look; and
there lies a strange fascination, when leaning against
the slimy sides of the wreck, in gazing backwards at his
solitary footprints marking the way he came.</p>

<p>On the extreme edge of the Haven, men have built an
hotel, thinking thereby to give the spot a prosperous
and populated appearance. And thrice a week a creaking
motor-bus deposits there its load of sightseers, who
drink a lot of tea on the blank terrace, and swarm over
the waste of garden, and onto the primitive wooden
jetty, whence boats are supposed to start for a tour of
the islands lightly pencilled in the haze. But the boats
are never visible; and presently the sightseers depart
in their bus; and the Haven continues to take no interest
either in the barren grey hotel nor yet in the babbling
tea-drinkers.</p>

<p>In the surrounding oozes of dark green, are rooted
shapeless forms, that might be whales, but are mostly
bungalows. One of these was presented to Stuart by
his brother-in-law Ralph Orson, on the occasion of the
latter’s marriage. “Might come in useful when you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
sailing in these parts,” quoth Orson, apologizing for the
poorness of the gift.</p>

<p>There was very little of sailing in its more graceful
phases round about the Haven. Occasionally the tide
brought up slow-moving barges, piled high with wood
or coal or bricks; these surmounted by the tiny dark
figures of men hoisting a clumsy bulk of canvas against
the sky, pushing frantically at giant pole or tiller, which
by comparison reduced the human to ant-size. The
white skimming sail would have been here a strange
anomaly, and the supple curve of pleasure boat. With
grimness tempered to mystery by their flying streamers
of smoke, the black trading-vessels alone ruffled the even
slant of the water, flowing, rippling, landwards to the
Haven.</p>

<p>Here then, Stuart passed the days following his renunciation
of Peter. He was disappointed that the
detached exultation of spirit was absent, that should
have rewarded the man with will strong enough to perpetrate
a theory. Exultation?&mdash;so far was it removed,
that at first he had to summon every atom of force he
possessed, to prevent himself from dashing theory onto
the rubbish-heap, and setting it alight, burnt-offering
to the common human love of a man for a maid. Just
at the moment when all his powers of reasoning and
thought and logic were most desperately needed, they
turned traitor; ran away; returned to mock him:
“Prig! pedant! cad!” No end to the insulting
epithets they volleyed at the stunned and cowering
leprechaun; and then ran again, too fast for pursuit or
argument.</p>

<p>“If that’s all you have to give me, then, curse you, I
might have taken the warmer thing!” thus leprechaun,
from the depths of want, to the hiding metaphysician.</p>

<p>Stuart waited, just holding in check the suffering
which cried out for some alleviating action on his part
... (he might so soon be in town&mdash;at Euston&mdash;Thatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Lane&mdash;“Come out, Peter”&mdash;and in the crushed sweet
smell of bracken on the Weald, laugh, and kiss her
mouth, and kiss again; and laughing, damn the Hairpin
Vision to beyond eternity, where it rightly belonged&mdash;all
this, so soon) ... Stuart waited. He would at least
give metaphysics a chance.</p>

<p>He strove to collect his ideas of yore; but they
rattled about in his head like dried peas in a box,
implements wherewith stageland strives to imitate a
rainfall. Meanwhile, round the shadow-side of the embedded
hulk, he stumbled one night upon a pair of lovers
clinging silently together, symbol of unthinking passion,
utterly happy in the belief that their momentary
divinity was immortal. Ordinary lovers&mdash;Stuart turned
sharply away, across the tract of dead white sand,
cursing as he ran; cursing his destructive brain and his
vision and his asceticism,&mdash;all that had been given him
unasked, to set him apart from those shapes&mdash;<em>from that
shape</em> on the shadow-side of the hulk. Damn it! yes,
damn it! One paid for too godlike a use of the shears.
Damn it ... he threw himself face downwards on the
sand.</p>

<p>The metaphysician stirred from lethargy, and spoke;
reminding him that he had seen the sequel to the idyll
in the shadow-shape of the hulk; reminding him of a
certain dingy group round a perambulator: “They had
hung on, and lost the vision.”</p>

<p>Stuart retorted: “They had also forgotten the vision,
so what did it matter?”</p>

<p>“Would you wish to forget?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” desperately. Any sort of rest rather than for
ever be self-tormented as now.</p>

<p>And then there was the thought of what Peter might
be enduring. The orange-sucker had never before
stayed to consider the orange. When Merle had dropped
from the trio, though perfectly aware of what was impending
during that last supper-party, Stuart had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
no after-movement in any way to help her. The trio
had inexorably to come to an end. The one left over
must butt through her crisis without whining. Male or
female, it was all the same. When a like hour visited
him, he would require neither sympathy nor yet props;
certainly not mercy.</p>

<p>All very well, these relentless standards, applied to
Merle. But they refused to apply themselves with like
success to Peter. Stuart did not know why. But he
told himself that he had behaved like a cad to Peter,
anyone would say so. For the next space of time, his
strongest temptation was to take refuge in the outward
appearance of his conduct&mdash;certainly caddish in the
extreme&mdash;and behind this fence, skulk backwards to
his desire: “And make the only amends a gentleman
can, considering how he has treated the girl.”</p>

<p>But that wouldn’t do. He knew, and Peter knew,
that what had prompted him to break with her was
very far removed from mere caddishness; and he
couldn’t now with any consistency start regulating his
conduct with an eye to the world’s approval.</p>

<p>A prig, then? a fanatic?&mdash;Let him but vilify in some
recognized term of opprobrium what he had done, and
he must perforce find himself an excuse to retract.
Would a prig have set a girl to care for him, and then
desert her for the sake of a vision which in turn deserted
him? Prigs do not stand upon their heads, but levelly
and beautifully upon their feet. He was too bad and
too mad to merit the epithet of prig. Fanatic, certainly.
And what was fanatic, closely examined, but word-covering
for anyone sufficiently clear in belief to prove
his theory by deed instead of mouthing it abroad for
others so to do? Theory would be a mere word, cold
and empty of significance, if the discoverer thereof were
not willing to apply it as touchstone to matters vitally
concerning himself.</p>

<p>No escape then, by road of cad, prig, or fanatic. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Peter been sufficiently unattainable in worldly status,
he could have spent a lifetime striving to win her,
without any self-reproach whatsoever to mar his ultimate
victory. But Fortunatus might claim his princess
when he willed.... So no princess for Fortunatus....</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;“They wrought a deeper treason,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led seas who served my needs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sold Diego Valdez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bondage of great deeds....”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What a fool, what a fool he had been to imagine he could
elude his bondage by merely choosing an inglorious profession!
This then was how they had at last contrived
to outwit him: giving him, in addition to all worldly
advantages, clarity of vision and power of brain; letting
him build up from these a working ideal,&mdash;and then
trapping him in a situation where he must in the very
use of it forfeit all happiness. Because he saw ahead,
because he gloried in the seeing,&mdash;oh, they had wrought
their treason cunningly, “led seas who served my needs”;
the two in the shadow-side of the hulk were kept in no
such bondage. Stuart was a genius of life&mdash;he might
not go back to Peter. He had lashed Peter to be a
genius of life&mdash;she might not call to him. They could
both see their vision of love dimmed by time&mdash;so they
might not pursue it to the dimming. And meanwhile
the two in the shadow-side of the hulk lay lip to lip,
bodies crushed together, believing their little moment
immortal. “They sold Diego Valdez....”</p>

<p>And here the stuntorian, up till now silent, gave a
sudden leap, and flung out a hand to pull Stuart from
the mire: “Just go back to her. Get above your own
theory, and kick it out of the way. What a stunt&mdash;if
you are big enough!”</p>

<p>“If you are big enough,” insinuated the stuntorian.</p>

<p>Metaphysician silenced him with a laconic “Cheat.”</p>

<p>No escape for Fortunatus. He knew, if for one moment
he ceased battling, how contentment would lap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
him round, and smooth him, and oil him, and blur his
vision of mist to a thickness of mutton-fat. He knew.
And must practise knowledge on a flesh-and-blood love,
not cherish it as a dry-as-dust theory. No escape for
Stuart. The lovers, still locked into one shape, still
murmuring brokenly to each other, passed in the dark
so close that they brushed against him where he lay;
where he lay and in biting scorn challenged God for
once to take the initiative, not make him do it <em>all</em> himself,
always.</p>

<p>No rest for Fortunatus. Leprechaun was now active
enough; squibbing and somersaulting to impress the
metaphysician, who with brilliant argument upheld
the ascetic, who alternately cursed and wrestled with
the man. The man had but a poor chance; though he
still continued to argue, as thus:</p>

<p>If he and Peter had indeed thrust forwards and on,
in the mortal blindness unmercifully denied to them,
could the gradual transformation of magic to disappointment,
thence to habit, slacking into uninspired content,&mdash;all
that he and she had visioned, sitting on a luggage-truck
at Euston; could these things be indeed worse
than his present turmoil of longing?</p>

<p>Yes! all three shouting now in chorus, leprechaun
and metaphysician and ascetic. Yes! For this was
sharp and keen&mdash;and quick. Even though each second
weighed an eternity, he was yet conscious that, viewed
from the distance of years, the time would seem a short
black tunnel cutting through into the day. While to
lose the pulsing sense of her walk, her voice, her touch;
to drop instinctive knowledge of her pleasure or her
sorrow; to cease from battling with her, for the joy of
the after-rest; to exchange passionate uncertainty for
placid possession; to happen no more on moments of
chance magic, and not to miss them; for strain to
depart, and youth, and memory of youth and strain,
and then envy of youth, so that ashore on the putty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
they should not even begrudge fiercely the exhilaration
of a run before the <span class="lock">wind&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A thousand times rather lie as now, with body writhing
into the dry white sand, and every nerve craving for
love lost. A thousand times rather fling “Peter!”
into the unresponsive silence, and blaspheme at her
steady defiance in not calling him back; defiance he,
not God, but he again had put into her. A thousand
times rather be stabbed through and through by single
recollections. Yes, a thousand times rather Hell than
Heaven, since from Hell one still could rise, but from
Heaven there was no more ascent to the heavens.</p>


<p class="p2 center">END OF PART II</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2>PART III</h2>




<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="smaller">“FOR HE HAD GREAT POSSESSIONS”</span></h3>


<p>Thus, gradually, belief was restored to Stuart,
and faith in the vision, and the vision itself.
And then came a quickening pride in the
thought of Peter, battling through to the same issue;
Peter, erect and balanced, with that half-smile of scorn
upon her lips; more his mate than ever now, since
with equal strength and without bitterness, they could
each stand alone, walk alone, guarding strange
memories.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours of squally weather tempted him to
put out to sea in his racing yacht. Blown half across
the Channel, he met with terrific resistance beating
back through a flying scud of wind and spray, all reefs
in, and rail deep under water. Nor did he for one second
think of relinquishing his hold upon life, nor of adjuring
the ocean, in approved fashion, to let him seek oblivion
in its coolness.</p>

<p>Reaching home, he slept, and did not dream. Slept
sound and hard. The next night he again saw the
lovers wandering amid that renewed tranquillity which
succeeds tempest. Though the sight of them still
stirred him to pain, the taint of envy had departed;
and he smiled, as, passing, he caught the inevitable
question whispered:</p>

<p>“And when did you first begin to love me, Letty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuart reflected with amused contempt that the
answer could not fail to be: “I think I must have loved
you always, dear heart....” He wondered what
would happen if he followed the impulse to warn them
whither they were straying in their blindness, tell them
the use of the shears&mdash;then laughed, imagining the
reception his harangue would receive: the male muttering:
“Some crazy loon!” and drawing closer the girl,
who would murmur, her lips against his neck: “He
doesn’t <em>know</em>, does he, dearest?”</p>

<p>But though the notion called forth a healthy self-ridicule
in the man who didn’t know, a throb within
him of common humanity, which he had hitherto
believed dormant, was queerly uneasy for all the sightless
lovers of all the world, stumbling on towards disillusion.
He felt like a diver who from drowning depths
had rescued a pearl, brought it up in his hand&mdash;“And
was looking about for the swine,” finished Stuart’s
sense of humour, also reawakened.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the uneasiness dogged him, and the
impatience. The philosophy of the shears was now
indisputably his; not from the far-off speculations of a
dreamer, but by claim of pain and payment. He had
animated theory with blood-sacrifice, so that theory
had become a live thing, a truth which he had no right
to retain, which must be flung to the world. After that,
let the world take it or leave it, as they willed; his
part would be done. They would probably leave it....
And again he burnt with a fiery impatience somehow
to pierce that thick denseness of spirit overlying mankind
like a pall; so that nine-tenths have lost grip of
their own lives, and the remaining tenth have too firm
a grip on other people’s; and most are unseeingly
miserable, but some benumbed in happiness; and all
without wings.</p>

<p>Stuart did not feel any vocation for the platform nor
the pulpit; neither had he any desire to throw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
theories on to paper and thus propagate them among
the unenlightened. It struck him that what he needed
was a disciple; some young enthusiast who, believing
in him devoutly and to the extent of imitation in all
things, would also zealously spread his creed by eloquent
tongue and by diligent pen. All prophets had their
disciples; a disciple was a necessary adjunct to the
master. Stuart was inclined to think himself modest
in only seeking one fervent youth to squat at his feet.
Most of the old Greek philosophers had founded a whole
school. Perhaps that would follow in time. Meanwhile,
let him but find some intelligent lad, tumultuously
unhappy, restless and miserable and knowing not what
he craved, and it ought to be a matter of ease to convert
him to the Hairpin Vision, the Essential Renunciation,
the Necessity of Conflict, and the Art of Ceasing to
Suck the Orange before the Orange Runs Dry of Juice.</p>

<p>&mdash;From the shadow-side of the hulk against which
Stuart leant, enumerating his ethics to the stars, a long-drawn-out
sigh quivered through the air; then a low
and satisfied grunt; both sounds expressive of the
mood in man, when, having reached a fatuity of content
too great for words, he has to resort to animal noises in
which to relieve his feelings. Stuart strolled round,
and stood gazing down at a reclining figure upon the
sand, figure which he recognized as one-half of the
lovers who had so often shattered his evening calm.</p>

<p>“Where’s Letty?”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” in languorous slumberous surprise. Then,
raising a thatch of ruffled auburn hair and an exceedingly
flushed face, the young man enquired: “I say,
have you got a match on you? I was just thinking
there was nothing on earth left for me to want, when I
discovered that I couldn’t light up.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked disgusted: was this a thing for a
fellow’s star to send a fellow, in answer to fellow’s wish
for a disciple? this creature who had nothing left on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
earth to desire except a match. In silence he proffered
his box; it was not worth while to withhold it.</p>

<p>“Letty’s mother had a sick headache to-night,”
gurgled Sebastian Levi, in answer to the query first
spoken. He was not so richly communicative as a
rule; but to-night he was rather beyond himself with
a father’s consent just won to his engagement, and
several glasses of wine tossed down in celebration
thereof; followed by one ecstatic embrace of his betrothed,
a rush at fifty miles an hour through the warm
sea-scented air, and much solitary starlight imbibed
from the dim flat shores of the Haven. So, from
drowsy oblivion of his fellow-man, he became suddenly
eager and willing to talk:</p>

<p>“We’ve often run out here before, Letty and I. It’s
quiet. And it’s only twenty minutes by car. I say,
how did you know about Letty? I suppose you must
have seen us.”</p>

<p>“I have occasionally noticed an indistinguishable
blur or two,” replied Stuart, sitting down upon a black
and moss-grown spar, and lighting his own cigarette.
“The blur being to-day shrunken to half its size, I
subtracted one from two, and asked you where she was.
And thus the mystery is explained.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pity. Mishtries should never be explained.
Who would have the veil lifted from the immortal
mishtry of love? Or would I seek now to know intimately
why the gods are so good to me, in giving me
my heart’s desire, and all my other desires, and a match
for my cigarette into the bargain? Unquestioningly
I accept their&mdash;benign&mdash;partiality&mdash;&mdash;” Sebastian
lingered slowly and carefully over the last words, and,
safely completed, stretched grateful arms towards the
heavens. Then, looking at these same arms rather
amazedly, as if in doubt as to what they were doing in
that eccentric position, let them drop again. “I love
you, Letty!” he murmured to some vision of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
radiant imaginings; then brought his gaze earthwards,
back to Stuart: “Thanks for the match,”
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Stuart shrugged his shoulders: “Lacking the match,
there might have been some hope for you; as it is,”
he turned away, “&mdash;good night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go,” pleaded Sebastian, unruffled by the
other’s abrupt censure. “It was only my nonsense
just now; I was working off steam. But I can talk
quite soberly if you’ll stop to hear me.”</p>

<p>“You’re not in a fit state to talk at all. You’re
thick; plastered with honey and treacle. Your grin is
seraphic; your rhapsodies are fatuous. You don’t
even resent my abominable rudeness. Why don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Why should I? I like you tremendously. And of
course I’m s’raphic. ‘There’s not the smallest orb
which thou beholdest but in his motion like an angel
sings still choiring to the young-eyed cherubims!’
That’s what my father was to-night&mdash;a young-eyed
cherubim. So was her father. So was Letty. She’s
accepted me. Her father has accepted me. My father
has accepted her. Everybody has accepted everybody,
and everybody has gulped down an enormous amount
of champagne. Hence Mrs. Johnson’s headache. But
I’m glad Letty couldn’t come out to-night&mdash;I’ve had
too much&mdash;I couldn’t stand any more&mdash;I’m dizzy.
When I say I couldn’t stand any more, I mean it
meta&mdash;meta&mdash;&mdash;” Sebastian lost the thread of his
discourse, repeated solemnly “meta&mdash;&mdash;” ... and then
re-found it in a different but equally satisfactory
direction: “I met her on the hill between Boscombe
and Bournemouth. Our fathers had been neighbours
years ago, and fell into each other’s arms. So there’s
no family opposition; we needn’t wait interminably
for the wedding. My father,&mdash;he’s Levi, the big
Universal Stores in Holborn&mdash;you know&mdash;he’s taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
me into partnership with a tremendous screw. Which
will leave me plenty of time for <span class="lock">writing&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Writing?”</p>

<p>“I’m a poet,” modestly.</p>

<p>“And what thin trickle of curds-and-whey verse do
you imagine can be born in leisure hours, while in
unctuous enjoyment of a tremendous screw?”</p>

<p>“Better verse than if I were a starving rhymester,
peddling my sweated wares, with chilblains on all my
toes. I don’t believe in the uses of adversity?”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>&mdash;“And to-morrow,” spouted Sebastian, unheeding
the ironic syllable, “to-morrow I buy her the most
wonderful ermine in all the regions of snow, to wrap
round her throat when I whirl her by night to this
desolate shore. That’s poetry, isn’t it?&mdash;when I whirl
her by night to this desolate shore!&mdash;Lord, man! her
throat is softer and whiter than foam ... when she lifts
her head to the moonlight&mdash;when she lifts her head to
look at me&mdash;she’s such a little wee thing&mdash;then the
curve of it makes me delirious ... as perfect as the
curve of that wave&mdash;look! before it breaks. Her
<span class="lock">throat&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Would you mind,” broke in Stuart very politely,
“not talking about throats?”</p>

<p>The lad glanced at him&mdash;then quickly away. “I’m
sorry,” he jerked out.</p>

<p>“And as for what you are pleased to consider the
partiality of the gods towards you,” continued Stuart,
goaded to an inexplicable heat of anger; “let me tell
you that you merely figure as their sport. I can’t
conceive of a greater sign of disfavour than to be thus
loaded with gifts. In time you will come to regard the
love which has been yours so easily, as a matter of
course, as something which has always been there. The
wealth that you have gained without effort, will cause
you presently to fold fat podgy hands over your smug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
waistcoat, too richly embroidered for good taste, and
give thanks that you are not as other <span class="lock">men&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“You’re wrong there,” interrupted Sebastian, even
his placidity giving way beneath this unforeseen attack;
“I mean to do a lot of good with my <span class="lock">money&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“And what can be more unpardonably priggish than
to do anybody good without doing yourself any harm
thereby? It’s like Father Xmas; I never believed in
the bountiful generosity of Father Xmas; his sacks
were too swollen, and his coat too heavily trimmed&mdash;like
the waistcoat of your future obesity. Oh, yes, you
will be a good man, and a generous man, and a prig,
and probably an alderman, and certainly Lord Mayor,
and perhaps also High Admiral of Spain. And you’ll
forget that Letty’s throat was white as foam, and
curved like the curve of a wave,&mdash;because Letty will be
yours, throat and all, whenever you want her. You’ll
never know fun, hard perilous fun, because you’ll never
seek peril; you’ll say that you have too many responsibilities,
as a husband and a citizen and a philanthropist,
to expose yourself unnecessarily. You’ll never be
splendidly weary with battle, nor yet know the leanness
of spirit which comes from desire unfulfilled, nor will
you grow breathless with the exhilaration of a race
against your own luck. The best things you are bound
to miss forever, my fortunate young friend, because the
gods have thought them beyond you&mdash;and have sent
you instead prosperity, domestic happiness, the course
of true love running indecently smooth. And therefore
it is that I regard you as damned, body and soul, and
you regard me as a <span class="lock">lunatic&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Not at all, confound your insolence!” Sebastian
had sprung to his feet during the tirade. From somnolence
to loquacity, and thence to truculence, were
easy transitions in his present mood; and not once did
the absurdity strike him of this sudden quarrel with a
total stranger, on the dim moon-washed sands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Haven: “not a bit of it. I look upon you merely as
one of those meddlesome people who have become
embittered by poverty and frustration, and can’t see
other people happy. The fox, you’ll remember, said
the grapes were sour.”</p>

<p>“Your shot is wide of the mark; as it happens, I’ve
only just succeeded in quenching my star, which was
most obstreperously luminous. And for the Lord’s sake,
spare me fable in <span class="lock">argument&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>And thereupon, something queer happened ... Sebastian
stepped forward, and seized Stuart in a wrestler’s
grip, and attempted to throw him down. In and out of
a clear patch of moonlight they swayed, in and out of
the black shadow of the hulk, silently, like clockwork
marionettes. Their build and strength were about
equal, but Stuart was the cooler of the twain, and just
held his own, wondering the while what was the exact
remark of his that had so infuriated his young opponent.
To and fro, in and out of the sharp white moonrays&mdash;till,
by a slippery dexterous movement, Stuart succeeded
in flinging aside Sebastian, who stumbled, and fell, and
rose again, covered with a glittering powder of sand,
and stood uncertain whether or not to renew the bout.
And then it would seem that he saw the other’s features
clearly, for the first time; for he exclaimed in quite a
different tone from what he had yet used:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Heron of Balliol, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But how&mdash;&mdash;?” Stuart found it disconcerting,
having met and insulted a nameless spirit in ghostland,
to be suddenly, and by this same spirit, accosted
as Heron of Balliol.</p>

<p>“They pointed you out to me last year, when you
came up for the Greek plays. You were the big classical
man of your time, weren’t you? They still talk about
your double first.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked pleased. “Which was your college?”</p>

<p>“Magdalen. I’m only just down. I say, may I run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
over again one evening for a talk? My name’s Levi,
Sebastian Levi. I’m staying at the Boscombe Hotel.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; delighted; perhaps you’ll introduce
your fiancée.” And it was a pity that no one was by
to twinkle amusement at the well-bred decorum which
had descended upon the antagonists.</p>

<p>“That’s my bungalow, the one that looks like an
inverted whale.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you find it dull?”</p>

<p>“Passably. I sail a good bit. Care to join me next
time the wind’s foul enough?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never done any sailing; but if I shan’t be in
the <span class="lock">way&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Not at all; you shall be passenger.” Carefully
ignoring their fantastic behaviour of a few moments
back, they strolled together across the shore, and over
the sand-dunes, to where the lamps of Sebastian’s two-seater
trembled athwart the road.</p>

<p>“Feel equal to taking the wheel? because if <span class="lock">not&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>Sebastian laughed rather shamefacedly. “Oh, I’m
not as bad as that. Would you mind starting her?”
he climbed to his seat.</p>

<p>Stuart swung the crank. “Here, you’d better take
my matches; I’m nearer home than you,” he tossed
the box into the moving car.</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully. Good night!”</p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>As he listened to the dwindling hum of the engine,
Stuart let his thoughts wander again to the matter of
discipleship. He had marked how swiftly the boy’s
sleepy content had been stung to passionate retort; he
was responsive, then; and evidently not lacking in
brains; altogether of the right stuff. Stuart reflected
further that it would be a far more creditable job to
drag a convert from a bed of roses than from a ditch of
nettles.</p>

<p>And Sebastian, crashing homewards along silent un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>winding
roads, was conscious of a beating excitement,
totally unlike his lulled lotus-dream of the past summer
nights. Strange phrases had Heron spoken to him ...
“I’ve only just succeeded in quenching my star.”
“You will never know the best things of all&mdash;the gods
thought them beyond you.”... Strange phrases&mdash;and
no one to warn a lover on the danger of having his
brain massaged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smaller">FOLLOW-MY-LEADER!</span></h3>


<p>All the next day, Sebastian Levi walked about
with a throbbing head, and could not decide
if he were suffering from the after-affects of
ecstasy, wine, or metaphysics. Certainly his thoughts
dwelt most persistently on the third of these, and this
even while Letty’s petal-soft lips were quivering, half-shyly,
in expectation of his eager kisses. Now he was
swept by a flood of rage, recollecting Heron’s contempt
of him; now he hated himself for his own Bacchic
confidences; then again and yet again he revolved in
his mind those few dropped sentences which hinted
so arrestingly at a new way of thought&mdash;a new way of
life. What did the fellow mean by his remark to the
effect that he had quenched his star, which was too
luminous? Did one then quench a star instead of
following it? And why? Why? What result could
possible ensue from such an act of madness?...</p>



<p class="tbpara">Sebastian’s father, Ned Levi, was of that species
known as the strictly agnostic Jew. He neither went to
Synagogue, nor did he keep the picturesque Jewish
holidays. He did not tactlessly allude to himself, in
company, as “the Chosen of the Lord.” He did not
wear enormous flashing diamonds in his shirt-front, nor
yet gesticulate over-violently, nor control, spider-fashion,
the entire financial affairs of Great Britain.
Likewise he ate ham with relish; and so naturally did
bacon and eggs form the staple breakfast dish, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
partaking of them was not in the least degree a daily
defiance. He was a little unostentatious man, with
light-red hair and moustache grizzling untidily to grey,
a quiet taste in clothes, and nothing to stamp him
Israelite save a slight lift at the bridge of the nose, a
kindly concern for the fortunes of even his most distant
cousins, and a keenness of business acumen which had
led him from a small grocery shop in the East End, to the
massive and celebrated stores in High Holborn.</p>

<p>He had married, when his success was already
established, a wife very much his superior in birth; a
quiet sensible girl, with poverty-stricken parents,&mdash;strictly
agnostic Christians. The two had vied generously
in their readiness to embrace the other’s faith;
and ended by leaving the matter for ever unsettled, and
marrying at the registrar’s.</p>

<p>Sebastian was brought up very successfully to no
religion at all, and an open mind that accepted with
equal tolerance his Christian relations of gentle birth,
and his more vivid and less reputable Jewish kindred.
He was a good-looking lad,&mdash;or would have been, had
not his auburn hair and dark eyes given him an aspect
curiously flamboyant; and amusing,&mdash;or would have
been, save for what seemed in him a tendency to show
off, but was in reality a lack of confidence, an inability
to get both feet planted firmly on the ground.</p>

<p>Also, ineradicable result of mixed caste and class,
Sebastian held very few neat safely-rooted opinions of
his own, and was liable to be dangerously fascinated by
daring ideas; especially by ideas that were rather
too far off for his attainment, but which held him by a
certain remote splendour. He was all response and no
initiative. He never got near enough to an idea to
perceive its flaws; he never got right through an idea,
and beyond it, and so free of it. He strained upwards,
and clung on,&mdash;or let go, and thudded to the ground.
Sometimes, accidentally, he broke things in his fall; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
then he sorrowed over them exceedingly; and sickening
of his intellectual scrapes, would steep himself in aught
that required no assistance of the brain. It was one of
these reactions that sent him spinning into the arms of
Letty Johnson.</p>

<p>Letty&mdash;well, what was Letty? Letty had soft brown
hair, which on Sundays was crowned by a hat of one
feather. Thus she knew her Sundays. And thus her
mother knew how costerdom was differentiated from the
rich good taste of prosperous folk who lived in a nice
house with a bedroom more than they needed, down
Turnham Green way. One feather, and no more. And
a velveteen costume in winter. And thin low-necked
blouses, winter and summer. And shoes with big pom-poms.
And, perhaps, little gilt side-combs, studded
with blue stones, perfectly unobtrusive. Thus the outward
and visible Letty,&mdash;on Sundays. Week-days
hardly mattered.</p>

<p>On the table beside Letty’s bed, might be found the
Sir Walter Scott birthday-book, a paper novelette, and
“Indian Love-lyrics,” by Laurence Hope. Inside
Letty’s head existed a quantity of far-fetched romance,
the jumbled remnants of a High School education, and
an uncertain sort of liking for the company of one
Balaam Atkins, bank-clerk, who came very often to
Turnham Green for supper.</p>

<p>Round and about Letty, Mrs. Johnson maintained
an atmosphere of careful and deliberate laxity. Often
the good lady was heard to declare that if Letty cared
to go on the stage, no objections would be raised.
Letty’s correspondence was always blandly ignored.
Letty might spend whole days on the river at Richmond
with a ‘jolly party,’ and if she came home after ten
o’clock with all of the party dispersed except her
immediate companion,&mdash;that was only to be expected
of twentieth-century youth, remarked Mrs. Johnson to
her husband. Indeed, Letty was given far more latitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
than she needed, and walked quite placidly in a small
area of liberty, wasteful of the wider spaces thrown
open by her twentieth-century parents. Just occasionally,
when his wife’s vigilance relaxed, Mr. Johnson
would forget how tolerant he was, and break out in a
row most refreshingly in the style of old-fashioned
paterfamilias. But he was always made to atone afterwards
for these aberrations, by taking his daughter to
a play emphatically ‘for the adult mind only.’ Such
performances bored Letty and bewildered her father;
but Mrs. Johnson had given forth the watchword of
the household: Be Broad-minded! and hers was the
ruling spirit.</p>

<p>Therefore, also, Letty took lessons in fencing.
“Though I don’t see what she’s to <em>do</em> with it?” said
Mrs. Baker doubtfully to Mrs. Johnson.</p>

<p>Letty owned for live stock, a girl-friend, Violet Baker,
who had been engaged to a fellow since two-and-a-half
years; a Persian kitten; and a younger brother, Luke;
she also occasionally remembered a God, imploringly or
in gratitude, when the world went very wrong with her,
or else very right.</p>

<p>And Letty was exceedingly pretty.</p>

<p>And thus are comprised her total assets. Till, on a
summer holiday at Bournemouth, Sebastian Levi came
along. Whereat she surrendered to him her all, including
the one feather of which he disapproved, including
her faint liking for the bank-clerk, and very certainly
including her girl-friend’s fellow, who, on Letty’s return
to Turnham Green, was to suffer fatally by comparison
with the tall pale-faced auburn-haired Sebastian;
suffer even unto extinction.</p>



<p class="tbpara">“... Because a man’s star leads him eventually
to places too comfortable for the lean spirit to rejoice
in....” Sebastian’s musings on metaphysics were interrupted
by Letty, as she swung beside him, where he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
upon the garden-roller. None of the other boarders at
the Farme would venture near that especial portion of the
grounds; it was known as the “little lovers’ solitude.”
“Little lovers” the pair had been nicknamed for their
apple-green youth. Twenty-two and nineteen; a swing
and a garden-roller; blue sky patching the thick green
shade; a girl’s voice, hushed for the very breathlessness
of love, speaking of white satin ... myrtle-leaves ...
Sebastian ought to have been very happy. Yet for him
perfection was already chilled to something less of
permanence than yesterday’s warm eternities; and:</p>

<p>“Surely, Letty,” he broke in, “you won’t want all
that display and fuss when we marry?”</p>

<p>Her head drooped. It was when Sebastian spoke thus
loftily, that her father’s favourite remark: “We’re as
good as other folk, my girl, if we like to consider other
folk as good as us. And that’s logic,” seemed somehow
inadequate. She felt that her lover stooped to her with ineffable
condescension, and she hastened to sacrifice to him:</p>

<p>“Would you rather I didn’t wear a white frock,
Sebastian? Would you rather I wore pink, or&mdash;or
something quieter?” and she bade a mute farewell to
all pretty silent dreams of herself looking like a picture
in the “Lady’s Pictorial”; of the gleaming elaborate
gown, to be worn afterwards, shorn of its train, at
subscription dances and private parties; then dyed
black for more matronly whist-drives; filmy veil that
should be lain aside and cherished in lavender and
memories, perhaps one day shown to her daughter ...
Letty sighed, and swung herself faster and faster yet,
breaking through the slanting sun-shafts, that slipped
together again in her wake, and were broken anew as the
board flew back.</p>

<p>“Would you prefer us to have a quiet wedding,
Sebastian? with no presents or bridesmaids or cake?
Father said something about grand doings and not
minding the expense, <span class="lock">but&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>He pulled her from the advancing swing into his
arms; the narrow seat dangled back empty of occupant.</p>

<p>“Never mind your father, Letty; he doesn’t understand.
Our wedding shall be such a tiny one that there
will be only just room in it for you and me and the
parson; it shall happen in some grey country church,
the sun streaming through its windows like youth
reviving in an old <span class="lock">heart&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I call that beautiful,” interrupted Letty softly.</p>

<p>“And you shall wear just whatever you like best.
But to me you are prettiest in a certain grass-green
cotton frock, and a floppety light-blue hat, because then
you look like bluebells in a larch-wood”&mdash;thus he
caressed her, and teased her, and spoke the romantic
nonsense her soul delighted in. And thus she was blissfully
content&mdash;till Willy Percival rolled his ball into
their Paradise zone, and came to fetch it, his mother in
apologetic pursuit: “Willy doesn’t know yet where he
isn’t wanted,” archly; involving much blushing and
dimpling and deprecation on the part of Letty, and a
rigid “Not at all” from Sebastian, mightily displeased.</p>

<p>“Can’t you stop these people from buzzing and
chaffing?” he demanded irritably, when Mrs. Percival
had withdrawn her offspring.</p>

<p>And again Letty beat back a wistful impulse to
confide in him how all this was really and truly an
essential part of the rose-coloured thrill of “being
engaged”; how immensely she gloried in the questions
and chaff; how any mention of his name, coupled
meaningly with hers, caused her to hold her blossom
head inches higher with pride; how like music were
her father’s jokes on the subject; how she had been
overwhelmed in delicious confusion when the blotting-pad,
which was common property at the Farme, was
discovered scribbled over and over with the mysterious
names: Mrs. S. Levi; Letty Levi; and then, unaccountably:
Letty Lovell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>And remembering this, Letty resolved now to unburden
herself of a weighty proposition that hitherto
she had not dared lay before Sebastian, lest it might rub
against an unknown rawness in him. She could never
quite disabuse herself of the notion that all Jews, even
her splendid lover, are necessarily over-sensitive and
forever on the wince. “Because I don’t see how they
can ever quite forget that they are Jews,” would have
been word-translation of her subconscious thought.</p>

<p>“Sebastian,” she caught hold of a lapel of his coat,
and snuggled nearer to him, while the garden-roller
gave an ominous lurch, “what do you think about
changing your name before we get married? would you
mind very much?”</p>

<p>“Rather a bother for nothing,” he rejoined lazily.
“But if you’re set on it, darling,&mdash;what aristocratic
title have you prepared for me?”</p>

<p>“Lovell!” ... breathlessly she hung on his decision,
blue-grey eyes fixed attentively on his face.
“Sebastian Lovell!” she repeated, dangling the combined
effect in front of him, as a child might dangle
a toy.</p>

<p>“Think I could live up to it?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re being a naughty boy, and teasing me.&mdash;But
really, Sebastian, I’ve thought it all over seriously,
and I chose ‘Lovell’ because it also begins with an
‘L.’ Of course, they say: change the name and not
the letter, change for the worse and not for the better;
but I believe that’s only for a girl marrying a man. And,
anyhow, superstition is only ignorance. And perhaps&mdash;no,
let me finish, Sebastian, because I’m awfully in
earnest about this,&mdash;perhaps your father won’t mind,
because Lovell is very like Levi, really; it has the ‘v’
in the middle, and all!”</p>

<p>“I’ll place the consideration of the v-in-the-middle
before my venerable parent this very night,” laughed
Sebastian. And: “I love you!” he whispered, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the sun-warmed web of her hair. “Letty, you’re
adorable; I love you!” seeking by these means to
stifle within him a certain sense of disloyalty; which
increased, when, on the morning after, she deplored
almost tearfully the break-up of the fine weather: “It’s
<em>our</em> weather, Sebastian; the weather you told me you
loved me in; and it’s got no right to finish so quickly,
before you’ve finished telling me.”&mdash;But Sebastian was
glad of the tempestuous change.... “Care to join
me next time the wind’s foul enough?”... He and
Stuart set sail together that very afternoon.</p>

<p>They were away for three days. Sebastian had
anticipated much stimulating discussion while sailing;
his host holding forth, one hand idly resting upon the
tiller; himself, the passenger, listening, stretched full
length in the lazy sunlight, his pipe in his mouth, the
waves lapping gentle accompaniment against the bows
of the boat. But Stuart talked very little upon the
voyage, and that mostly in curt vigorous language
concerning canvas and harbours, and the evil behaviours
of the same. He was quite a different being to the
eccentric metaphysician of the Haven. Also, though he
treated his guest with excellent politeness for the first
few hours of companionship, he accepted heartily the
boy’s embarrassed offer to “be of assistance” in the
management of the boat; and thenceforward plunged
him into an existence resembling equally a monkey’s
and a cabin-boy’s; involving much perilous swarming,
and unknotting, and a process known as ‘reefing’;
much battling with drenched ropes and stubborn tiller
against obstinate and treacherous winds. A persistently
clouded sky overhead; very little to eat, and
that uneatable; hard salt breathless days; evenings
spent in small water-side inns; Heron exchanging
bewildering technicalities with others just arrived in
port. Then an uncomfortable lumpy bed, smelling
inexplicably of seaweed, and offering but little rest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
a stiff and aching body;&mdash;“Glad to turn in, eh, Levi?”&mdash;decidedly
Sebastian was disappointed of the long
intimate conversations, explaining riddles which had
haunted him ever since his first fantastic meeting with
Stuart Heron.</p>

<p>He brought back with him to Bournemouth a great
astonishment at being yet alive, hope which he had
forfeited many times in each single hour. Also, acute
memory of an instant when presence of mind had
prompted him to haul at the right sheet in an emergency,
and Stuart had favoured him with a sudden curly smile,
peculiarly his own, and a brief word of approval. And
now Sebastian underwent sensations of weary flatness
and depression, inhabiting once more the luxurious suite
of rooms engaged by his father at the Boscombe Hotel.
He debated all the while what thing he could do to win
again that quick smile from Stuart. He wanted that
man’s approval&mdash;more than aught else he wanted it&mdash;would
force it somehow, no matter by what extravagance
of action. He believed Stuart despised him, and
the thought cut like rain-rods in a north-easterly. “If
he doesn’t despise me, then why won’t he tell me more
about his&mdash;his ideas?”</p>

<p>But on no subsequent visit to the Haven, was Stuart
to be drawn. “My creed is the wrong sort for an
engaged young man; better leave it alone. By the way,
you promised that I should see your fiancée.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see her to-morrow, if you’re anywhere about.
The whole Menagerie are swarming over in the excursion
bus, to view this interesting spot. Letty and her
mother and father will be with them. No, not me,
thanks; I couldn’t stand three solid hours of the
Earwig and the Cabbage-rose.” Sitting on the window-sill
of the bungalow, mournfully jabbing tobacco into
his pipe, he favoured Stuart with a vivid account of the
‘Menagerie,’ as he chose to term the boarding-house
wherein his beloved dwelt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a ramshackle building stuck among pine-trees,
a mile or two out of Bournemouth; and the proprietress&mdash;landlady&mdash;hostess&mdash;whatever
you call her,
has no more idea than Adam of management. She
advertised in the papers, by way of an original start:
‘Charming home-like residence for the summer months;
croquet, tennis, and private bathing-hut; terms
moderate; run on Bohemian lines!’ That last statement
fetched the victims. Such a crew!”</p>

<p>“Which of your prospective family-in-law was
attracted by the Bohemian lines?” queried Stuart,
enjoying the recital.</p>

<p>It transpired that Mrs. Johnson had caught sight of
the advertisement, and had remarked to her husband,
one breakfast time, “Matthew, we are getting into
a Groove. What we want, what Letty wants, is
Bohemian society. The best Bohemians, naturally.
Here’s our chance. I’ve heard they take liqueur in
their morning tea, instead of milk and sugar, like
Christians!” Mr. Johnson had here stated firmly that
nothing would induce him to do that; and Letty had
further propounded: “whether they’ll like the sort of
people <em>we</em> are?” And her father had replied with his
favourite remark: “We’re as good as other folks, my
girl, if we like to consider other folks as good as us. And
that’s logic!”</p>

<p>“So they all came; except the young brother, Luke,
who went off on his own,” finished Sebastian, somewhat
sulkily. He resented being made to talk, when he so
itched to hear what the other had to say. And he
believed Stuart was being purposely provoking and
reticent.</p>

<p>“And what about the Earwig and the Cabbage-rose?”</p>

<p>“It’s a General and his wife. He’s brown, and about
eighty; hobbles and shakes; a shrivelled little chap
with beady eyes. She’s enormous and pink, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bulging petals, as if she’d been left out too long in the
rain; some of the petals have fallen, and the rest are
loose. She skits and sirens, and wears her evening-gowns
too low. Now I ask you, Heron, don’t you consider
she’s a bad influence for Letty? I do.”</p>

<p>Stuart pondered the matter: “I don’t think you can
call a woman a bad influence because her outside petals
are falling from her shoulders. However, I’ll have a
look to-morrow, and judge for myself.”</p>

<p>But by the morrow he had forgotten the impending
intrusion; and it was a mere accident that when the
Menagerie trooped noisily on to the little wood and iron
jetty, Stuart should just have been at its foot; unroping
his skiff from among a welter of palings and steps,
anchors and chains and beams, rust-eaten and weed-green.
His trousers were rolled thigh-high over his bare
legs; he wore an old blue sweater, and a sou’wester
protected the back of his neck from the sun. Standing
up to his knees in water, he glanced up in some curiosity,
mingled in equal proportions with indifference.
The various members of the party were easily enough
distinguishable by Sebastian’s word-pictures: Here the
Earwig and the Cabbage-rose; she in a large leghorn
hat, waving a sunshade, and calling to Stuart in shrill
tones: “Ferry! Hi, Ferry!” There, Archie Mowbray,
the very spit of a Kipling subaltern; avowing,
when questioned on the subject, that he ‘had no
patience with Kipling.’ Besides him, the untidy girl
of his adoration, Ethel Wynne, her blouse agape where
it lacked buttons, her fingers stained with nicotine.
And&mdash;yes, that must be ‘Maddermerzell,’ disturbingly
piquante French governess of a small boy, who, Stuart
surmised impartially, would in five seconds be headlong
in the water, and require saving. And there Mrs.
Percival, for eleven months of the year most respectable
of British matrons that ever wore a hair-net, now, by
some strange seizure of rejuvenescence, making a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
giggling fool of herself with the doggish husband of
another matron, not rejuvenated, and therefore icy of
eye. That pretty little maiden in white, with soft
hair shadowed to brown beneath her big burnt-straw
sun-hat, Stuart had no difficulty in recognizing as Letty,
the other ‘little lover’ from the shadow-side of the
hulk; Letty, looking demure, as she hugged the secret
of how well <em>she</em> knew these shores&mdash;by moonlight.</p>

<p>Stuart pushed off vigorously; then, leaning on his
oars, looked up again to see if he could pick out Mr.
Johnson from among the chattering gesticulating
crowd. The Cabbage-rose was still desperately hailing
the boat: “Hi! Boy! Ferry! we’re coming with
you!”</p>

<p>“Not if I know it,” muttered Stuart; quite determined
that the Haven should not see him again till
cleared of the Menagerie. Then a graceful figure,
auburn-haired and supple, thrust a way to the front of
the jetty, and cried, in tones sufficiently supplicating to
melt glaciers into torrents:</p>

<p>“Mr. Heron! Oh, Mr. Heron!”</p>

<p>“Aureole Strachey!” With a few powerful strokes,
he brought the boat back to the palings, roped it
securely, then plunged again into the water, and waded
ashore. Aureole flew down the jetty, and met him on
the sand:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad to see you; of all people in the
world, you! you who awoke my sleeping&mdash;but let’s get
away from these gorillas!” indicating with distaste
the Cabbage-rose, who was approaching with the
evident fell intent of an introduction. “How I hate
them all, directly I come again in contact with someone
from the old life.” Then, as Stuart drew her
hastily in an opposite direction, “Have you&mdash;do you
know where Oliver can be?” sinking her voice to a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Oliver is in America, looking for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“But how silly of him. Why is he looking for me in
America? It’s such a big place&mdash;it would take him
years to find me, even if I were there. And I’m not.
I wouldn’t have gone to a place where it would be so
difficult to be found.”</p>

<p>Stuart looked puzzled: “But he wrote to me a few
days after the&mdash;um&mdash;episode on the Broads, saying he
had returned to the house in Chelsea, hoping you were
there; that you had been, and gone again, with all your
luggage, and left a note for <span class="lock">him&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“‘Good-bye; I am a pilgrim for the land of freedom!’”
quoted Aureole readily. “You told me, don’t
you remember, that he would certainly follow me, and
that we’d have a perfectly lovely scene together, and
that he’d never neglect my individual femininity again.
And if he has deserted me, and gone to America, then
it’s your fault.” She drooped her full crimson lips
reproachfully at Stuart; who, disliking this reminder of
his disgraceful machinations, made heated reply:</p>

<p>“He <em>did</em> follow you. If you say you are bound for the
Land of Freedom, and then come to Bournemouth, I can
hardly be blamed, can I?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I meant freedom of the soul,” murmured
Aureole, and her eyes filled slowly with tears. It had
been a shock to hear that her husband was so far
away.</p>

<p>Then Stuart began to laugh: “If you <em>will</em> be subtle
with Nigger, and talk about Pilgrims and Lands of
Freedom, naturally his thoughts lumber off on a wild-goose
chase in the direction of the ‘Mayflower’ and ‘Hail
Columbia.’” Mentally he substituted ‘wild-duck chase,’
but refrained from being unkind aloud, because Aureole
was weeping unrestrainedly now, and he felt compelled
to cheer her to the best of his ability. “Never mind.
I’ll write to him directly he sends some address, and
tell him to come home. Meanwhile, you’re quite comfortable
in the menag&mdash;&mdash;at the boarding-house, aren’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
you? Or why not move to the hotel? you can use me
as Oliver’s banker, till he turns up, you know.”</p>

<p>“I can’t move to any hotel,” she flared at him. “It’s
<em>my</em> boarding-house. Mine. And it’s in such a horrid
m-m-muddle!”</p>

<p>Stuart sat down on a hillock of sand: “D’you mean to
tell me that you were responsible for that advertisement?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to earn his respect; show that I could
stand by myself, be free of him and the world and everybody&mdash;except
Nature. I’m a Pagan.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear child,&mdash;no, don’t cry!&mdash;Pagans don’t
run boarding-houses.”</p>

<p>“It’s a private hotel.”</p>

<p>“Well, even private hotels. Not usually.”</p>

<p>But Aureole felt she had been censured sufficiently by
this young man, who had taken such a vivid interest in
her wayward personality, when, in London, he had
urged her to Norfolk, by a vision of her swaying form:
‘always among reeds’.... And then again had urged
her away from Norfolk by much adroit talk on the
subject of Ibsen, and pampered souls, and earthquakes.
So that from him she had hoped for more
sympathetic understanding of her movements and
motives:</p>

<p>“I wish you had let us alone. People shouldn’t
interfere between a husband and wife. Oliver and I
were in perfect harmony before you meddled and sent
him to America. And, anyway, what I do now is no
business of yours. I’m surrounded by adventurers and
harpies, and losing hundreds of pounds a week, if you
want to know. And when Oliver arrives, you can tell
him of my ruin and misery, and how you gibed at it all;
you, whom he thought a staunch and faithful friend!”
After which passionate denunciation, which scorched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the tears in her eyes to brown points of flame, she
walked swiftly away from him, in the direction of the
adventurers and harpies awaiting her upon the jetty.</p>

<p>“I believe she’s right,” murmured Stuart. Perhaps
he ought not to have tampered with matrimony as he
had done. But he was so truly convinced that every
married couple ought to be well stirred up at least once
a year, to prevent them from setting into a mould. And
what is the good of conscientious convictions unless you
conscientiously induce others to act up to them?</p>

<p>And anyway, he was hardly to be blamed if Nigger so
absurdly misread a cryptic allusion to the land of
freedom!</p>



<p class="tbpara">It was the after-dinner hour at the Boscombe Hotel;
and Sebastian Levi, pacing up and down the thickly
carpeted lounge, listening to the tinkle and silken swish
all about him, watching the waiters move to and fro
with the coffee-services, threading a deft way between
the visitors in evening-dress, felt impatiently that this
was all an unreal stage set, as: ‘Curtain rises on hotel
lounge, luxuriously furnished; guests grouped about,
with natural appearance of animated talk.’ Felt that
the only realities lay with a solitary figure, black and
wiry against the pale shadow-land of his chosen retreat;
Stuart Heron, probably at that moment pacing the
ghostly wind-blown shores of the Haven, even as he,
Sebastian, now paced in the hot artificial glare of his
prison-house&mdash;so he termed it!&mdash;and wished, in a tumult
of divine discontent, that he were now beside Stuart,
re-living in talk one of their strenuous battling hours at
sea, when every nerve was strained taut to catch the
racing tide into harbour.</p>

<p>Sebastian wondered if he wanted to order the car, and
drive over to The Farme&mdash;and Letty?... Not just
yet.... Something trembled on the verge of decisive
action....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he went quickly from the lounge into the
smoking-room:</p>

<p>“Can I speak to you privately, father?”</p>

<p>Mr. Levi, senior, looked his surprise. He was enjoying
a late whisky and soda, and a mild political chat
with some middle-aged cronies, and rather regretted
leaving these amusements.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, my boy,&mdash;if it won’t keep till the
morning.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t keep.” Sebastian spoke breathlessly;
his hair was ruffled as by many winds; his dark eyes
flamed with strange fires, as he noted the numerous
podgy somnolent figures showing dimly a-sprawl in the
thick smoky atmosphere; ten-thousand-a-year figures!&mdash;Sebastian
attempted to express his attitude towards
them by violently slamming the smoking-room door
behind him ... but it was padded, and refused to
close otherwise than in a fashion both hushed and
respectful; respectful to ten-thousand-a-year within.</p>

<p>“Well, Sebastian, and what is this very important
matter that won’t keep? Anything connected with
your poor mother’s pearls for Letty? Is that it, you
grasping rogue? And what will your sisters say to that,
when they are grown-up enough to know that pearls are
pearls? hey?” Mr. Levi switched on the lights of their
private sitting-room, and took up his stand in front of
the empty fireplace. “Hey?” he repeated, quite
prepared to yield the pearls. He was fond of little
Letty.</p>

<p>Sebastian moved restlessly up and down the room;
crossed abruptly to the window and flung it open,
knocking over a tall palm on its stand as he did so. The
breeze flapped the curtains far out into space. This was
better....</p>

<p>“I just wanted to tell you, sir, that your offer of a
junior partnership in the business, and fifteen hundred
a year to begin with, is an extremely generous <span class="lock">one&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on,” said Mr. Levi, frowning a little. How much
more did the young beggar expect, at twenty-two?</p>

<p>“But I don’t want it. I don’t want any allowance.
I’d rather be without.”</p>

<p>His father surveyed him during an instant of blank
astonishment. The waiter entered with the whisky-and-soda
Levi had ordered to be sent up after him, from the
smoking-room. He tossed off the remainder of the
glassful, and offered his son a drink.</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” coldly. He was anxious for the storm
to break upon him, anxious to begin suffering his
martyrdom. This dalliance with whisky, therefore,
struck him as a needless compromise.</p>

<p>“And what does Miss Letty say to this, hey?” Levi
had no idea what was at the bottom of the boy’s
startling renunciation of ease and luxury; but he had
been warned that young men sometimes pick up odd
phases at Oxford&mdash;debts or old editions or Hedonism.
Sebastian had always been of an excitable and impulsive
temperament; a <em>liquid</em> temperament. This phase,
whatever it was, would not last long. Mr. Levi twinkled
indulgently from the hearthrug:</p>

<p>“What does little Miss Letty say to it all?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I haven’t told Letty yet.”... What would
Stuart say, how would Stuart look, when told of this
shattering tribute to his influence?...</p>

<p>“You can’t marry on nothing a year, you know that,
don’t you? pretty little Letty-birds need pretty little
warm nests built for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh”&mdash;the lad twitched impatient shoulders. Stuart
had not mentioned how asceticism could be made to
work in with love. He must be questioned presently
on the subject.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Sebastian,” advised his father
suddenly; “Come, what’s it all about?”</p>

<p>The quick change from levity to kindliness, touched
the boy almost to the point of explaining what were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
ideals that had induced him to strip himself so dramatically
of the world’s goods. And yet&mdash;how to put into
words that uncomfortable stinging creed which he
hated, and which yet held his brain as in a sort of vice,
fascinated his thoughts to the exclusion even of Letty?
And then that weak longing to impress Heron, prove
that he understood his doctrines to the point of sacrifice&mdash;damn
Heron! perhaps now he would condescend to
talk to his disciple, instead of making polite enquiries
<i>re</i> Letty’s health. And, finally, that glimpse of an after-dinner
hour in the well-furnished, well-warmed, well-appointed
smoking-room&mdash;conflict of winds carefully
shut out&mdash;doors that would not bang&mdash;waiters who
walked noiselessly&mdash;conversation on stocks and shares
and politics, carefully calculated not to excite the
torpid brain.... Oh, Lord! would he grow, or rather
dwindle, thus, if he went into his father’s business and
accepted chunks of his father’s income? Was he
started on that way, the night he had prattled so
absurdly of his happiness to Stuart?... <em>Damn</em>
Stuart! always the point swung back to that imperturbable
gentleman. And how could a fellow explain to
Levi, of The Stores, High Holborn, the bewildering and
topsy-turvy morality of the shears? Sebastian plunged&mdash;fatally:</p>

<p>“It’s just because of myself, father. It isn’t that I
feel in the least that I oughtn’t to be enjoying my
income because other people have less. But I think&mdash;I
know I’m better without your money.”</p>

<p>The effect of his speech was electrical. Quite suddenly,
Ned Levi began to bellow.</p>

<p>“So that’s it, is it? And I’m to sit here and thank
you for the honour, am I? Well, you can go&mdash;anywhere;
do anything; I don’t care. I’ve done with you. If my
money isn’t good enough, you needn’t touch it. Want
a purer sort of gold, do you? I knew this was bound to
happen some day. That’s what one has a son for.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
And still muttering incoherent commands to Sebastian
to get out of his sight, the agitated old man himself
lumbered from the room, his hand trembling, his grey
eyelashes stiff with rage. Sebastian’s unfortunate
phrasing had hit his father on a dread quite unsuspected;
dread that one day his only son, born to the best of
everything, would be ashamed of the way the
Levi wealth had been amassed; ashamed of trade;
ashamed of his humble parentage.</p>

<p>&mdash;“But it seemed to me the boy was all right, when
he got engaged to Johnson’s girl. No la-di-da notions
about him then. And now he’d rather do without
money, than touch mine that was made in honest trade.
Suppose he thinks I cheated it out of people’s pockets;
sold inferior stuff, and got swollen on it. Well, it don’t
matter&mdash;it don’t matter...” brooding on to-night’s
culmination of all his fears. If his wife had been alive&mdash;he
could have had it all out with her, all his bitterness
and disappointment; and she would have said in her
sensible way: “Never mind, Ned; the boy doesn’t
know what he’s talking about; he’ll come round all
right,&mdash;he’s a good lad, really.”... But his wife was
dead. And his two daughters&mdash;he had heard them
flippantly remarking to visitors that they were “bringing
up dad in the way all parents should go!”&mdash;not
much consolation to be had from Editha and Ivy. Ned
Levi, in his loneliness, wondered if it ever struck the
strange hard young people of modern times, how very
little fun it was to be a parent.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Sebastian had no idea that his thrice-twisted motives
could have been misconstrued by his father to aught so
simple as a shrinking from wealth earned in trade. He
was even unaware that he had hurt his father&mdash;thought
he had merely made him angry. He determined,
standing on the hotel steps, and letting great gusts of
clean air lift the hair from his heated forehead, that both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Letty and her father were entitled to hear without delay
what he had done. Then, and then only, would he allow
himself to tell Stuart&mdash;and his heart raced madly for an
instant, as it struck him he might still have time to get
over to the Haven this very night.</p>

<p>“Do you want the small car, sir?” queried the
liveried porter respectfully.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;” Sebastian remembered that a too
frequent use of his father’s automobile was hardly
compatible with his recent hotly spoken resolutions.
He walked a few quick steps along the sea-front ...
then returned, and ordered the two-seater. There would
be no possibility of reaching the Haven unless he drove.
And, after all, “once more doesn’t count.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“We needn’t ask who <em>that</em> is!” chirped the
Cabbage-rose, when the throbbing of an engine was
heard outside the Farme. “I don’t suppose it’s a
visitor for <em>us</em>, do you, Mrs. Strachey?”</p>

<p>Letty blushed, and ran to meet Sebastian. A few
moments later, with a puzzled air, she fetched in her
father from the garden. Sebastian wanted to speak to
him. “No, Pups, I don’t a bit know why.” Mrs.
Johnson, from a deep-rooted conviction that men could
not be trusted to be broad-minded without a woman to
guide them, joined the conclave unasked. The quartette
had the dining-room to themselves.</p>

<p>... “Decided not to accept your father’s allowance?”
repeated Mr. Johnson incredulously. “Why
ever not?”</p>

<p>And again the disciple was confronted by the difficulty
of explaining the creed of the master, to apparently
unsympathetic listeners. He stole a glance at Letty, and
felt braced by her answering smile. Her blue eyes were
no longer bewildered&mdash;they shone at him like stars.</p>

<p>“It’s a man I know,” Sebastian started rather
lamely, “who has put me in the way of&mdash;well&mdash;of thinking
rather differently about life. About wealth that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
isn’t striven for, and&mdash;and things one gets too
easily.”</p>

<p>“I like argerment,” Mat Johnson put in briskly.
“I’m quite a good one for argerment. Now what I say
about what you say he says, is this: unless we don’t
mind taking things easily from other folk, other folk
will take them easily enough from us. And that’s
logic.”</p>

<p>“But that would be nothing to do with me; that
would be their concern, and their loss of the&mdash;oh, of the
fun of striving, don’t you see, sir?” Sebastian was
afraid he was making out rather a poor case for the
defence. “It’s with the effect of easy achievement on
me personally that my friend is concerned. He says
I’m in danger of growing fat.”</p>

<p>Matthew Johnson, himself inclined to corpulence,
took the allusion as a personal affront, and was coldly
silent, while Mrs. Johnson interrupted indignantly:
“I’m sure you have an elegant figure, Sebastian; hasn’t
he, Letty?”</p>

<p>Letty said nothing; only smiled softly, as at some
misty golden thought.</p>

<p>“You introduce me to this pal of yours, Levi,”
continued Mr. Johnson, recovering his good-humour, and
tilting back his chair at the ceiling; “and we’ll tackle
the matter together. I daresay he’s young, and maybe
I can put him right on one or two bits. And as for you,
run back to your dad and tell him you’ve thought
better of that fifteen hundred quid a year, and that
you’ll pocket it with many thanks. See?” and the
note of rising authority on the last syllable drew from
Sebastian a quick:</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. But I won’t. That would be rather
stupid and inconsistent, wouldn’t it? After I had so
definitely refused either to go into the business or
accept the cash.”</p>

<p>“Oho! you’ve refused the partnership in the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
as well, have you? And how, may I ask, d’you mean
to support my daughter when you’re married? Or is
your Mightiness going to refuse her too?”</p>

<p>Sebastian held his head very high, as he replied that
nothing in the world would induce him to give up Letty.</p>

<p>“And how d’you mean to keep her, eh?” repeated
his future father-in-law, stubbornly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson detected trouble brewing; and clinched
matters, so she thought, by a brilliant compromise:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you take half of what your father offers
you, Sebastian? I’m sure seven hundred and fifty
pounds a year is quite as much as any wife needs to
start on. Isn’t it, Letty?”</p>

<p>“Taking half would be exactly the same as taking
all,” retorted Sebastian, desperate now of forcing
understanding.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there, my lad. It ’ud be just less
than fifteen hundred quid by one half of fifteen hundred
quid, which is seven fifty. But there’s to be no halves
about this business, mother; d’you mark me, Letty?
Are you attendin’, Sebastian Levi? I’m not going to
have my girl waitin’ about the best years of her life for
a young fool who didn’t know when he was well off.
I like your father; we were neighbours once, he and I;
and I liked you well enough till now, though not a
patch on him. But unless you come to me in a week or
two with all these taradiddles biffed out of your head&mdash;then
biff goes the wedding!” Mr. Johnson rose to his
feet, and in time-honoured fashion whacked at the
table with his clenched fist. “And meantime you’re
not to see so much of her, either. Come along, mother;
come along, Letty”; summoning his women-folk from
the room, he marched forth. Mrs. Johnson followed
meekly; her laborious tolerance shrivelled to nothing
at this first hot blast from the actual furnace of
‘advanced ideas.’</p>

<p>Sebastian caught at Letty’s hands, as she passed <span class="lock">him&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Letty?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, dear; I do understand.”</p>

<p>“Really?” he was surprised at her emphasis.</p>

<p>“Really and truly. Good night ... darling,”
scarcely breathing the last word, she slipped out of his
arms and vanished. Left him, marvelling....</p>



<p class="tbpara">The car and the road again, and the buffeting masses
of wind. Sebastian’s exhilaration, dashed somewhat by
his two recent interviews with unresponsive middle-age,
whipped itself anew to a tremendous height. For now
he was clear of worldly burdens; stripped like a runner
for the great race; and with the discovery new upon
him of just how easy of accomplishment were the
things that had never before entered into the range of
normal possibility. The quest of spiritual adventure....
And the Haven rushing nearer and nearer, as sombre
patches of pine-gloom, spectral open spaces, tore helter-skelter
in the opposite direction. Soon he would be
telling Heron&mdash;and the older man would flash him that
quick curly grin of approval.... Now the flat oozing
stretches of mud, and the glimmer of a sluggish tide,
far out towards the horizon.&mdash;And now all brakes
jammed on&mdash;the car ceased to hum, and stood immovable,
but still vibrating from the reckless pace at
which it had been driven.</p>

<p>Sebastian leapt down the sand-banks, on to the
beach; found Stuart musing, bare-headed, at the door
of the bungalow; evidently quite oblivious of wind
and tempest. And now, in actual presence of his idol,
a sudden diffidence swept over the boy. This Stuart
Heron, while stimulating the most fanatical exploits in
others, yet contrived himself to retain an atmosphere
entirely ordinary. Flushing scarlet, and rather breathless,
Sebastian dashed into his recital:</p>

<p>“I’ve been wanting to tell you, Heron, how immensely
I admired your ideas&mdash;about renunciation&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
all that; how they struck me as fine&mdash;and clean
... like star-spaces ... when everybody else is so
beastly, and grabs at things, money and&mdash;and furniture,
the heavy tangible articles that block out the view and
the air.... I’m expressing myself horribly badly, I
know, but you’ve rather knocked the stuffing out of me
lately; just lately, when I was smuggest. And anyway,
I don’t want only to jaw; anybody can do that. So I
turned it about&mdash;your philosophy, creed, religion,
whatever you like to call it,&mdash;chewed it, and worried
over it, and cursed you up and down.... And to-night
I chucked up my whole future as it was mapped
out for me; told the Guv’nor that I wouldn’t take his
fifteen hundred a year; take it, and loll on it as if it
were a sofa of cushions. Chucked up my partnership
in the business; and, I suppose, all chances of a comfortable
marriage just yet. Chucked it all up....”</p>

<p>He stopped. The impetus which had carried him so
far, gave out suddenly. He was still a bit dazed as to
the actual reasons which had inspired his recent
startling performances; was just conscious of a mighty
upheaval in his affairs, overwhelming changes starting
on the morrow. For the present, tired out, he craved
only to hear the surge of praise due to <span class="lock">him&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Chucked it all up,” he pleaded....</p>

<p>Stuart shifted his pipe into the corner of his mouth.
His gaze was still bent outwards to the sluggish line of
tide on the horizon.</p>

<p>“Rather a theatrical proceeding, surely?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smaller">“RUN ON BOHEMIAN LINES!”</span></h3>


<p>Sebastian owned a hundred pounds per annum,
bequeathed him by legacy; which sum Stuart
had induced him to retain:</p>

<p>“I agree with you it would be far more effective to
renounce that as well, and confront the world as the
penniless son of the rich Ned Levi. But it isn’t done,
my lad; if it were, I shouldn’t be trading in diamonds.
Theatricality is only a species of fat. If you strip yourself
because it gives opportunity for your dramatic
faculties, you’re feeding hard, all the time; feeding on
the astounded faces of your friends, on your own ringing
accents, on the picturesque contrast of your life as
it was yesterday to what it will be to-morrow. You
mustn’t be picturesque, Levi, your tawny locks are
against you as it is. Your forty bob a week will ensure
you a pleasantly mediocre existence in a furnished bed-sitting-room.”</p>

<p>Sebastian looked worried; he wished Stuart would
not exhibit so many mental acrobatics. Last week he
could have sworn the man was preaching total renunciation
of all worldly goods, in order to make the struggle
as strenuous as possible. Now he had doubled and
twisted again to something entirely different. And
beyond all the inconsistencies, Sebastian glimpsed a
splendid consistency, a paramount truth, but, as
usual, too high up for him to do aught but cling to it
by the finger-tips. And seemingly he had blundered
already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve given up my room at the hotel, and I think I’ll
go to the Farme for the rest of August and September,”
he announced tentatively; “it’s not expensive, and I
shall be near Letty.” He might have added: “and
near you.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“And it will be quiet for writing,” he continued.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to write?”</p>

<p>“I want to throw your theory of the shears into a
book; in fact, all your theories.” Sebastian tried to
make the announcement without blushing, and failed
miserably.</p>

<p>“Volume of ethical essays? Treatise on metaphysics?&mdash;Good
Lord, man,”&mdash;a horrible thought
struck Stuart&mdash;“surely you’re not going to butcher me
to make a book of minor verse?”</p>

<p>“No, I hardly regard you as a lyrical subject,” retorted
Sebastian, with some show of spirit,&mdash;he wasn’t
always going to let himself be badgered by Heron!
“The novel is the best form of literature for wide
circulation,&mdash;and, after all, we do want the truth to
reach the masses. I’ve got the title fixed already:
‘Shears,’ by Sebastian Levi, dedicated to Stuart Heron,&mdash;if
I may?” with a return to the old shyness.</p>

<p>Stuart offered no active opposition, but he felt
doubtful. Perversely, ever since the advent of his
keen young disciple, he himself had been less keen. He
was not sure now if indeed he wanted a disciple?...
It was agony to watch Sebastian doing <em>his</em> stunts&mdash;and
doing them badly! This Jewish boy was too responsive,
too enthusiastic, too flexible altogether; he tempted
Stuart to do his worst&mdash;and Stuart was uncomfortably
aware of just how bad his worst could be. He longed
for firmer material against which to pit himself....
And this sent his thoughts flying to Oliver Strachey in
America&mdash;and to Oliver’s wife in Bournemouth. He
felt more guilty over that affair than he cared to acknowledge;
and wondered once or twice if he ought not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
himself to take in hand the muddle at the Menagerie,
pending Nigger’s return. So now he enjoined Sebastian
to let him know just how chaotic were Aureole’s affairs,
morally and financially.</p>

<p>Sebastian had decided to ignore Mr. Johnson’s commands
to see less of his daughter. Without previous
word to Letty, he arrived at the Farme, in quest of a
room, late the following afternoon; and found the place
deserted, save in the square-flagged hall, a couple of
rather forlorn persons standing beside a pile of dusty
luggage.</p>

<p>“We’ve been waiting over half an hour,” explained
the plain prim female of the pair; “I sent Mrs. Strachey
a card when to expect us, but I suppose it got mislaid
in the post. There are no servants anywhere. And
Bertie gets such cold feet, travelling,” indicating her
pallid young companion. “When I pulled the bell-rope,
it came off in my hands. Do you suppose she will
charge much for the damage? Is she like that?”</p>

<p>Sebastian’s reassurances were drowned in the hoot
of a motor-horn, and a chorus of laughing chatter.
Through the wide windows and through the open door,
a miscellaneous crowd swarmed into the hall, and paused
abruptly at sight of the strangers.</p>

<p>“Aureole, forward please, and serve,” remarked
somebody flippant. And Aureole stepped apologetically
from the throng, striving to smooth her tawny hair,
loosened under the motor-veil.</p>

<p>“You must forgive me; of course I’ve muddled
dates again. It’s Mrs. Gilchrist and her husband, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“No,” contradicted the prim girl, “it’s Miss Fortescue
and her brother. I wrote you were to expect us this
evening. You are Mrs. Strachey, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,&mdash;but&mdash;but you said you couldn’t come till the
end of September,” stammered their hostess. Whereupon
Miss Fortescue produced Mrs. Strachey’s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
letter, bidding them welcome on the fifteenth of August;
damning evidence before which the culprit remained
merrily unabashed.</p>

<p>“I am a goose! Let’s run round and see where I can
put you. It was a shame to let you wait; we were
picnicking. Did you ring?... Oh, I see! It doesn’t
matter in the least; we’re breaking things all day long
here. Mr. Mowbray, do be an angel, and help Ada
carry up these trunks; you are so strong.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mowbray, a stolid bronzed young man, evidently
in the army, signified his willingness to act as porter.
And then Sebastian, who had noted with relief the
absence of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson from the party, broke
off his conversation with Letty, and, drawing Aureole
aside, asked her if she could find him a room anywhere.
“Because I’d like to move in at once.”</p>

<p>She scrutinized him intently ... then her gaze flickered
to Letty.</p>

<p>“Yes. I see. You are feeling the pull&mdash;the strain.
She is the moon, and you the tide ... it draws and
draws ... I understand, Mr. Levi.” She motioned him
to follow her up the wooden stairway which rose from the
centre of the hall. Miss Fortescue and Bertie had preceded
them, and: “This is the rummest boarding-house
I’ve ever known,” the latter was heard whispering to his
dazed sister, as Aureole and Sebastian approached them.</p>

<p>Not aware of aught unconventional in her reception
of the Paying Guest, Aureole stopped on the first landing;
and, frowning with a sort of reproach at the various
unresponsive doors, said she believed that all those
rooms were full.&mdash;“You see, I thought you would be
Mr. and Mrs. Gilchrist; and then I expected you the
day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“And where would you have put me if I had been
Mrs. Gilchrist the day before yesterday?” queried the
prim girl from the Midlands, trying to cope with the
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here,” their hostess ran lightly down a flight of
steps branching into a wing of the rambling old building;
and displayed an enormous double bedroom.
“Perhaps&mdash;perhaps you two young men wouldn’t
mind sharing?” hopefully. “I should have to put
you in an extra washstand, naturally. You can have
Mr. Mowbray’s.”</p>

<p>Sebastian, rather enjoying matters, wondered of
what other necessities the long-suffering Mowbray was
to be deprived. All the same, if he was to write, he
would want a room to himself; and this he made clear
to Aureole, who looked worried,&mdash;and enquired irrelevantly
of Miss Fortescue:</p>

<p>&mdash;“Would you like a cup of tea in the mornings?”
She assumed an expression of portentous gravity, as
though she had recollected something: “It’s extra,
<em>of course</em>.”</p>

<p>Miss Fortescue agreed: “Oh, of course!” glad to
find this symptom of dawning sanity in their most incompetent
landlady. “Will you show me my room,
please,” she added firmly.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’d better have this one,” said Aureole,
very reluctant. “It’s meant for two, ...” she pondered
the matter, gazing absently at Sebastian; who, uncertain
of the exact plight into which the advertised
“Bohemian lines” were about to plunge him, again
reiterated his plaintive request for a single room.</p>

<p>Then Aureole dived into her bag, and brought forth
a crumpled sheet of paper, which, opened out, proved
to be a blend between a map of the house, a time-table,
and a fever-chart.</p>

<p>“Let me see: Miss Bruce is leaving on the twenty-second,
but Mr. Vyvyan Leclerc comes in on the twenty-first
to take her room, so <em>that</em> won’t do.”</p>

<p>Quite obviously it would not do, in more senses than one.</p>

<p>Aureole continued poring over the much-bescribbled,
much-erased paper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“The dairy room is empty for three days; the Lloyds
left in a temper over the breakfasts. You could start
there, Mr. Levi. And then perhaps for a week or two
I could get you a room in a cottage near by&mdash;only ten
minutes’ walk. And after that, little Verney is away
for a week-end; he wouldn’t mind if you slept in his
bed as long as you don’t disturb his moralities.”</p>

<p>“His&mdash;what?” from Sebastian. The prim girl turned
pink.</p>

<p>“His morality plays. He’s mad about them; and
has a cardboard model fixed up, with all the puppet
characters.&mdash;That would bring us to about the beginning
of September, wouldn’t it? Oh, well, somebody is sure
by then to have lost patience with me, and quitted, and
left a room vacant. So that’s all right, isn’t it?” and
she raised wistful brown velvet eyes to Sebastian, who
replied gravely:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Strachey, you have again mistaken identity.
I am a Jew, indeed, but <em>not</em> the Wandering Jew.”</p>

<p>“You’re not satisfied with the arrangements?” disappointed.
She puckered her brows yet again over the
fever-chart. “Would you mind sleeping in an attic?”</p>

<p>His imagination leapt. “I should like nothing
better.”</p>

<p>They all four trooped upstairs to inspect. The Farme
was a sprawling mansion of two storeys only. From the
second, a narrow twisting staircase, not unlike a ladder,
led to what were, once upon a time, granaries.</p>

<p>“This is the best of them,” Aureole threw open a door.</p>

<p>The attic revealed fully satisfied Sebastian’s
“theatrical instinct,” as Stuart would have called it.
Here his book could be written. Here, in shadowy
company of Chatterton and Francis Thompson, he
could be Starving-Genius-in-a-Garret; lord of his four
walls.</p>

<p>“This will do splendidly, thanks,” he informed
Aureole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must get you up a bed from somewhere,” she
remarked thoughtfully. “I wonder....”</p>

<p>She said no more. But Sebastian suspected that
Mr. Mowbray was doomed.</p>

<p>“And what about my brother?” demanded Miss
Fortescue.</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear Bertie’s fate, which he foresaw
as hopeless, Sebastian returned to the hotel, and
broke the news of his impending departure to his father,
who received it in grim silence.</p>

<p>Then he made his usual evening pilgrimage to the
Haven, and laid before Stuart his impressions of the
state of affairs at the Farme.</p>

<p>It was evident that the management of the boarding-house
was proving rather too much for Aureole; and
she ran it in a fashion that certainly marked a new and
eccentric era in that particular line of business. The
boarders were compounded of three separate strata;
members from her own social and artistic circle, such
as Archie Mowbray, little Verney, and Ethel Wynne,
who were there by way of a lark, and to “give Aureole
a leg-up”; respectable folk, like the Johnsons and the
Fortescues, and others from the Midlands and the
suburbs of London, who usually departed after their
first day, spreading a report of “heathenish goings-on”;
unless they stayed on, because secretly fascinated by
the difference between this bizarre establishment and
the more usual article. Finally, the Doubtfuls, with
profession a trifle misty and laughter a shade too loud.
Aureole would fain have rid herself of some of these,
but did not quite know how to set about it. She relied
on her visitors for sympathy and assistance in a manner
that was wholly disarming; would send one to the
town for butter, if she ran out of the commodity; beg
another to lend his cherished motor-car for the common
weal; would relate confidentially how the cook had
just left&mdash;“so we must put up with a scratch dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
isn’t it tiresome?” Or, taking a guest for companion
on a shopping expedition, would question casually:
“Do you like salmon?” and, on receiving an affirmative
reply, order eighteen shillings’ worth to be sent immediately
to the Farme for lunch. Nor did she think it
necessary ever to rise from her slumbers till noon; with
the result that breakfast, unsuperintended, resembled a
steeplechase more than anything in the world; each
person with a separate fad, entering at a separate time,
calling for separate food&mdash;or sometimes merely grabbing;
wandering to and fro from the kitchen; sounding bells,&mdash;occasional
outbursts of rage, when Aureole’s foggy
ideas of quantity had misled her on the near side.
Nevertheless, her very helplessness aroused a dormant
quality of chivalry in the boarders, so that they put up
with an astonishing amount of discomfort and incapacity,
flattered to find themselves treated in the
spirit of an accidental society house-party. The great
amusement was to watch the bewildered entry of new-comers;
mark their slow emancipation from the set
state of mind which expected to find a framed copy of
rules, hours, and terms, on their bedroom wall; expected,
indeed, to find a bedroom wall, which rarely
existed till Aureole, in collaboration with the fever-chart,
would discuss who could with impunity be ejected
to make place. Idle to speculate how often Archie
Mowbray had travelled with his polo-boots and hair-brushes.</p>

<p>About a week after the advent of Sebastian, chaos
reached its supreme height. Aureole, deeply in debt,
found the weather too warm for effort, and decided to
let things rip. They ripped. A great many problems
she solved by simply staying in bed; others, less
adjustable, reduced her to the verge of angry tears.
Ada, invaluable housemaid, bethought herself to give
notice. Aureole would dearly like to have done the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“Que diable fais-je donc dans cette galère?” she
demanded impatiently of Letty, as they undressed
together in the bathing-hut.</p>

<p>“Je ne say pas,” replied Letty, in careful High
School French.</p>

<p>“Sir James and Lady Merridik are due this evening.
Thank goodness, I’ve got quarters for them, at least.
Facing north, to be cool&mdash;or was it a south aspect they
wanted, because of the cold? He’s an Indian judge, so
he’s sure to feel the climate, but I forget which way
they feel it. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tant pis!</i>” Aureole slipped into a most
becoming bathing-dress, tied a black silk handkerchief
round her flaming curls, and lounging against a miscellaneous
heap of deck-chairs, wet and dry towels,
tumbled garments both masculine and feminine,
shrimping-nets, spades, and greengages, she watched
Letty, in the earlier stages of disrobing. This wooden
bathing-shed, given exclusively for the use of the
Farme, was a little separate chaos of its own, a sort of
annexe to the major chaos. While some undressed in
it, some waited to undress, and some, already undressed
and in the water, were awaiting their opportunity
to come out till those undressing were in the water,
when the first set would dash in and encounter in the
doorway those who were waiting to undress. The men
of the party were supposed to take their dip earlier,
before breakfast, when the sea was iciest, or directly
after, and risk apoplexy. But the laggards usually
contrived to overlap, and their drippings made the shed
untenable before the turn of the ladies. Add to all this a
defective latch, which allowed the door to swing open if
directly leant against, the demands of the little Percival
boy, who throughout the morning was in shrill need of
spade or pail or buns or fishing-net; add a large earwig
colony inhabiting the chinks between the boards;&mdash;and
it will be understood that the Farme bathing-shed
was hardly a spot to choose for confidential conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Aureole remarked suddenly: “Why
has Mr. Levi quarrelled with his father&mdash;and yours?”</p>

<p>Letty bent to tie up her sandals. “Sebastian has
given up all his money.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was a queer thing to do. Why?”</p>

<p>Letty evaded the point: “He doesn’t know I know
why.”</p>

<p>“But you do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>Willy Percival hammered at the door, which instantly
gave way. “Oooo-oo!”&mdash;Letty caught up a towel
and huddled it close, looking like a water-nymph taken
unawares by a mortal.</p>

<p>“Please, may I have my pail?”</p>

<p>Aureole tossed it through the aperture.</p>

<p>“No. The other one. The coloured one.”</p>

<p>“Run away, Billikins, and don’t bother.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you <em>nearly</em> ready?” came a heartrending
chorus from outside, accompanied by the chattering
teeth of some blue-faced individual longing to get dry.</p>

<p>“Yes, very nearly, Mr. Fortescue.&mdash;Why?” repeated
Aureole to Letty, struggling in a chaste attempt
to don her red serge white-anchored costume, before
letting slip the rest of her garments.</p>

<p>“Because ... but you won’t tell? he doesn’t know
I’ve guessed.”</p>

<p>Aureole smiled loftily. “Go on. I don’t tell things.
But I’m interested. He’s a curious type.”</p>

<p>“It’s a Test,” whispered Letty, in a hopeless tangle
of on and off, scarlet knickers and lawn camisole, and
hair in light brown clouds over her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Test? Of your father, you mean?” and Aureole
knit her brows.</p>

<p>“No. Of me. You see, he was much richer than us,
and I suppose he got it into his head that I loved him
for his money and not for himself. So he’s given it all
up. When he thinks he has proved me enough, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
he sees it makes no difference, he’ll take it back
again.”</p>

<p>Letty stood upright now, fully robed for her plunge;
and before the speckled little square of looking-glass
which hung on the wall, tried to tie her hair into a red
and white spotted handkerchief. “When he has proved
me enough,” she whispered to her glowing reflection.</p>

<p>Aureole clasped her hands round one shapely knee,
and pondered the matter:</p>

<p>“It’s romantic, of course. Ultra-romantic for this
century. But then he’s a Renaissance type. Denys
l’Auxerrois&mdash;have you read Pater? And ... yes, it
suits him. I believe you’re right. You have rather a
wonderful instinct about matters concerning him,
haven’t you? wonderfully simple and direct ...
piercing through complexities to the crystalline heart.
Now I, I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aure-<em>ole</em>! Aure-<em>ole</em>! the tide will be too high
unless you hurry up. And there are two frozen corpses
on your doorstep.” Thus Ethel Wynne, compassionating
the shivering spectres of Fortescue and Mowbray.</p>

<p>Aureole, who just had settled into her favourite
attitude for lengthy discussion of her peculiar temperament:
prone on her back, hands clasped behind her
head, scrambled now to her feet, rather annoyed at the
interruption.</p>

<p>“It’s their own faults. The arrangement was for the
men to bathe directly after breakfast. Come along!”
she held out her hand to Letty, and they ran together
down the beach.</p>

<p>Sir James and Lady Merridik drove up in a cab that
evening, at the hour when the miscellaneous members
of the household were gathered in the hall before
dinner. A second cab, piled high with luggage, followed
up the drive a moment later; Mr. and Mrs. Durward-Jones,
their two children, dog, and governess, had
weeks ago booked the very first-floor front double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
bedroom into which Mowbray and the cabman were
now lugging Lady Merridik’s multitudinous boxes.
Mrs. Durward-Jones meant to have that room; so did
Lady Merridik. Lady Merridik was shrill and flippant;
Mrs. Durward-Jones deep-toned and abusive. The
stairway, congested by boxes, formed the main scene
of battle. The clamour was deafening, aided by the
performance of Fritz, the waiter, upon the gong, and
the barks of the Durward-Jones dog. Finally, both
ladies turned to Aureole, demanding what she intended
to do in the matter. Glancing wildly about her for a
means of escape, Aureole flung herself upon the chest
of an apparition whose face was suddenly illumined by
the lantern swinging in the porch.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Oh, please, please, Mr. Heron, take me away!”</p>

<p>Stuart took her to the theatre, immediately, and
without paying the slightest heed to the raging debate.
The next morning at breakfast, Lady Merridik appeared,
blandly smiling. There was no sign of the Durward-Jones
party.</p>

<p>“Always best to let these things adjust themselves
by natural means,” remarked Stuart to Aureole.</p>

<p>“Natural means?”</p>

<p>“Survival of the fittest. Now look here, Mrs. Strachey,
what about letting me treat the whole Menagerie in the
same fashion; sling out all the harpies and adventurers,
square the landlord&mdash;till how long have you rented the
Farme? End of October?&mdash;and set detectives on Oliver’s
track to bring him home to Chelsea to look after
you.”</p>

<p>Aureole shook her head. “It would be no good slinging
everyone out; there are dozens more coming in.
And they’d all bring lawsuits and breach-of-promise
acts against me, because I <em>did</em> let them the rooms.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll hunt round for a competent manageress,
instal her with a salary, and you can leave whenever
you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think I’d touch your money?” she flashed
at him proudly.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">But&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Besides, I won’t have a horrid prying person here,
who will see what a mess everything is in; see that I’ve
<em>failed</em>....”</p>

<p>Stuart walked about the empty breakfast-room, hands
in his pockets, pondering deeply. Conscience had driven
him to reconnoitre, and now the same conscience informed
him very clearly that he could not allow his
friend’s wife to continue her present burlesque of
management, unprotected, accumulating enormous
debts. One owed something to one’s pals; Stuart hid
a rather special affection for the imperturbable Nigger
Strachey. But if Aureole refused to smash the establishment,
and refused to have a manageress,&mdash;well then,
what was he to do?</p>

<p>&mdash;“Stay here, and control matters yourself,” suggested
Aureole, divining and answering his thoughts.
With a mischievous glint beneath her heavy eyelids,
she added, “I don’t mind <em>you</em> knowing the worst;
after all&mdash;you’re responsible!”</p>

<p>And as it really seemed the only solution to the
problem, Stuart consented.</p>

<p>Speculation ran riot as to the identity of the mysterious
stranger. Later in the day, Aureole introduced him as:
“My husband’s friend” without further explanation.
The husband’s friend became a scowling and unpopular
permanency. He marvelled how he came thus to be
saddled with the white elephant of Aureole’s folly;
nevertheless, there seemed no way of shaking off the
boarding establishment till the 31st of October, or till
Oliver’s return. He at once wrote to Oliver, care of the
latter’s bank, trusting that there the address would
have been forwarded.</p>

<p>Aureole he alternately bullied and consoled, quite in
the spirit of a working partner; and she, relying peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>fully
on his competence, forgave him for missing this
excellent opportunity of being in love with her. Almost
forgave him.</p>

<p>A couple of rigid old maids disbelieved the “husband’s
friend” story, and left at once. Stuart found this
annoying. Neither did he like it when the fussy little
man from Shropshire pointed out items on his bill incorrectly
charged to him: “I do <em>not</em> have a bath every
morning, Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Heron.”</p>

<p>Stuart went in search of Aureole. “How many
baths has Mr. Kibble had this week?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?” virtuously indignant.
“Ask his wife.”</p>

<p>“We’ve put him down six, but he says he has only
had one. He must have had more. How does one
control these things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, knock off the extra half-crown from the bill,
and chance it!” laughed Aureole.</p>

<p>Stuart returned to his fuming interlocutor: “We
have decided to believe in your integrity rather than in
your cleanliness,” he said suavely, counting out Mr.
Kibble’s change. Mr. Kibble left immediately, with
his wife and child.</p>

<p>Least of all Stuart liked it when it devolved upon
him to give Vyvyan the boot.</p>

<p>“Vyvyan” had booked his room since a considerable
time, though letters perpetually postponed the day of
his arrival. Somehow or other, his unknown personality
had captured the imagination of the female portion
of the boarding-house. They gathered from his correspondence
with Aureole, that he was comparatively
young, unwedded, owned a motor-car, and was at
present travelling on the Continent. An attractive list
of hints from which to draw deductions. Archie Mowbray
and Bertie Fortescue began already to suffer from
spasms of jealousy, when Aureole, who since the advent
of Stuart was not allowed any more to take her break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>fast
in bed, read aloud a telegram to say “Vyvyan”
might that afternoon be expected.</p>

<p>“At last we shall have a young man in the house,”
quoth Ethel Wynne; which was cruel to Mowbray, who
loved her; and to eighteen-year-old Bertie. Sebastian
could not of course be counted, being manifestly Letty’s
property. And Stuart wore a pencil behind his ear, by
way of protection, to intimate that he was to be viewed
in a business capacity only.</p>

<p>Bertie’s sister entered the breakfast-room, and
enquired of everybody how they had slept, and asked
everybody with a cold if their cold was better, and
passed the salt, and placed herself carefully between
her brother and the Ostend-Plage Girl, whom she
suspected of sirenic intentions. The Ostend-Plage Girl,
who never passed salt, and who wore a soiled creation
of white serge and light blue pom-poms, promptly upset
the equilibrium of Bertie’s sister, by announcing: “I
quite intend to fall in love with Vyvyan, don’t you,
Aureole?”</p>

<p>“I believe he is going to mean something,” murmured
Aureole.</p>

<p>Stuart grunted.</p>

<p>“What! no mackerel left <em>again</em>?” from the Disagreeable
Female, whose name nobody ever seemed to
know.</p>

<p>Letty offered hers: “I haven’t touched it yet; do,
please, take it. I’m not hungry.” And Mrs. Percival
looked archly at Sebastian: “Not hungry? dear me!
now I wonder why that is!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson exchanged significant glances with her
husband. She had only been able to keep him from an
open row with Sebastian, by frequent allusions to
Letty’s loss of appetite:&mdash;“and what it would be like
if you forbade her to see him, Matthew&mdash;&mdash;” “So
tactful of the fellow to come and plant himself under
the same roof, directly after I’ve told him not to call so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
often, isn’t it?” but he restrained his smouldering
wrath, nevertheless. Letty was his pet, and he hated to
see her leaving her food; good food, that he had paid
for.</p>

<p>The talk veered round again to Vyvyan; and the
Cabbage-rose skittishly proposed making him an apple-pie
bed: “We always used to have no end of that sort
of fun when I stayed at Lyn House&mdash;Lord Burchester’s
place, that is.” She broke off her reminiscences to
throw the Earwig a solicitous: “Johnny, dearest, is
no one looking after you?”</p>

<p>The Earwig mumbled, and spilt the milk. He was a
very ancient and decrepit Earwig. And Ethel Wynne,
who sat beside him, sprang up with an unnecessarily
quick: “Oh, am I in your place? So sorry. Do come
here and look after your husband yourself!”</p>

<p>The Ostend-Plage Girl broke into smothered giggles.</p>

<p>“My egg isn’t fresh,” said the Disagreeable Female.
And looked relentlessly at Stuart; who afterwards
privately relieved his feelings to Sebastian, by a prolonged
outburst on the evils of boarding establishments:</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Levi,&mdash;it’s a most villainous contrivance
of civilization, to pack stray people together
under one roof, as you would cats into a home; each
little group at table with their separate wine or beer or
Apollinaris, not passing the bottle in good fellowship,
but sticking labels on it, for its safer preservation.
Chance companions are the finest to be had, on the
road or at the inn, that I maintain. But this compulsory
herding, this miserly meaningless thin-blooded&mdash;&mdash;How’s
the book getting on?”</p>

<p>“Nearly half-way through.”</p>

<p>“Rather quick work, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I must pelt ahead with it while I’m in the mood. I
won’t show it to you till it’s complete, though.”</p>

<p>“Right!” Stuart was glad of the reprieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s come!” announced Ethel Wynne, that afternoon.
She had sighted a motor-car outside the house.
A quiver of excitement thrilled the group gathered for
tea under the lime trees, as Aureole walked away to
welcome Vyvyan, on the threshold of the hall.</p>

<p>Vyvyan did not at once enter. He had first to seek a
room near by for his cousin-once-removed. That is,
unless Mrs. Strachey could manage.... No? Ah, well,
doubtless they would find something. She had been so
ill, the cousin, and had come down to Bournemouth for
some fresh air. Mrs. Strachey would excuse him for an
hour?... He appeared at dinner, a florid person,
with an ingratiating smile under his auburn moustaches,
and a debonair manner with the ladies. He was sure he
would enjoy his stay at the Farme; had been looking
forward to it immensely. A charming fellow; even
Bertie’s sister succumbed to his fascinations. But
Aureole was curiously frigid. After dinner, Vyvyan
ran round to see if his cousin-once-removed were all
right; she had been so ill! He was seen taking her for
a little walk along the esplanade.</p>

<p>The same evening, Aureole had an earnest confabulation
with her partner.</p>

<p>“We can’t have that sort of thing in the house,” with
the demure severity of a Quakeress.</p>

<p>“Hang it all! what am I to say to him?”</p>

<p>“Just tell him to go. And to remove his cousin&mdash;for
the second time.”</p>

<p>“It’s deuced awkward,” growled Stuart.</p>

<p>“Not from one man to another. <em>He</em>’ll understand.”</p>

<p>Then Stuart exploded his wrath: “Comes of comic
advertisement! The fellow naturally thought ...
Bohemian lines! you see where they lead to!”</p>

<p>Aureole walked away, with her head in the air.</p>

<p>Vyvyan received his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé</i> with protestations of
astonishment and regret at having unwittingly offended
Mrs. Strachey. His manner at lunch the next day, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
tinged with gentle reproach. Aureole wore an apron,
and her rebellious hair was gathered into a bun, by way
of signifying that her Bohemianism had limits. An air
of strain hung over the meal. By the evening, Vyvyan
the debonair, Vyvyan, the fairy prince so eagerly
awaited, Vyvyan had gone. So had his cousin&mdash;twice
removed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smaller">IL TROVATORE</span></h3>


<p>Aureole was beset by a fear that her ejection
of Vyvyan had somewhat impaired her claims
to Bohemianism, as set forth by the advertisement.
Wherefore it was one evening that she suddenly
bethought herself to invite the ‘Troubadours’ to the
Farme.</p>

<p>The Troubadours were a singing quartette who performed
thrice weekly in the Pavilion Gardens. Their
national costume consisted of a darkly flung cloak, a
slouched hat, and a mask; occasionally the cloak was
abandoned, showing beneath it a garb of gay-hued
tatters: further atmosphere was imparted by a beribboned
guitar. Therefore some slight confusion existed
as to whether the Troubadours were intended to be
grandees of Spain, or else those light-hearted medieval
wanderers trolling their ballads of praise to the Kings
of France&mdash;who usually retaliated by hanging the ballad-monger.
Either way, the effect was picturesque enough,
on the improvised wooden platform, lit by the few
flickering footlights, and encircled by a dark band of
trees. The tenor of the quartette possessed a really
melodious voice; his songs were mostly of the Arab-Gipsy
variety; type that perpetually invite a lady to
come forthwith and be wooed in some spot where she
is not, preferably a gondola, a caravan or a desert. He
presented rather a fine romantic figure, singing thus,
head flung back, hazel-green eyes half-closed, voice
languorous with passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“That man has suffered,” whispered Aureole to Archie
Mowbray. Who made reply: “Oh, I dunno. Think
he’s a gentleman, then?”</p>

<p>“It’s just possible to suffer without being a gentleman,”
with fine scorn. To which Archie protested
uneasily: “Oh, I dunno.”</p>

<p>The party from the Farme numbered six: Letty, the
Cabbage-rose, Ethel Wynne, and little Verney being
also present. Sebastian had retired to find inspiration
in the attic, directly after dinner, as was now his
wont; he had told Letty he was engaged on the production
of a masterpiece of fiction; and she, rejoicing
in his genius, had bidden him recite the words by which
the book was to be dedicated to her,&mdash;which assumption
produced an awkward silence.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of time for that,” he had said at
last, feebly. “It may never be published, you
know.”</p>

<p>But of course it would be published, cried Letty;
and without complaint sacrificed her evenings with
him. Though it would have been bliss to have had
him here, beside her, in the warm darkness.</p>

<p>A final duet was warbled from the stage, while the
tenor of the troupe went among the dim blur of faces
in the audience, holding a silver tray, and showering
jests and gallantries in return for the shillings that
clattered thereon. This necessary part of the performance
always sent hot waves of shame surging up Aureole’s
neck, for the fancied anguish of soul the man underwent
during his pilgrimage of degradation. The jokes were
doubtless a poor and threadbare garment to cover
naked pride,&mdash;Aureole shut her eyes tightly, with the
result that her shilling dropped beside the tray and onto
the parched grass. The man paused to grope for it,
exchanging the while grave witticisms with the donor.
Bertram Kyndersley knew no such writhings as Aureole
attributed unto him; being indeed mainly concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
with the amount of the evening’s takings, in his capacity
of treasurer to the Troubadours.</p>

<p>“Under my feet, perhaps,” remarked Aureole; and
Bertram made swift reply: “Impossible, Lady Auburn-hair;
they could hardly cover the coin; it would peep
out at the edges.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Aureole became extremely friendly with
this particular Troubadour, and laughingly bade him
serenade her window at dawn, since he could utter such
fair impromptus.</p>

<p>“Alas and alack! and in all Hampshire how am I
to find my lady’s window?”</p>

<p>“If I let fall that secret, will you let fall your mask?”
Aureole looked meaningly at the strip of black velvet
which concealed the upper portion of his face.</p>

<p>“Give me but a chance!” And with that the
Troubadour passed on, between the benches, and back
to the platform.</p>

<p>Aureole began to scribble feverishly on the back of
her programme, which she then folded into a note.</p>

<p>“Take this round to the tenor of the quartette,”
she commanded little Verney; “hurry up, or they’ll
be gone,” for the spectators were already beginning to
stir and disperse in the darkness, and the flaming footlights
had one by one been extinguished. Verney
obediently went. The missive ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Will you not stay your caravan an hour or two,
and with your companions, give me the pleasure of
your company this evening at my house by the pine
trees? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans cérémonie</i>&mdash;for are we not fellow-gipsies
on the highway of Art?</p>

<p class="sig">
“<span class="smcap">Lady Auburn-hair.</span>
</p>

<p>“P.S&mdash;Tout passe, tout casse, tout lasse.”</p></div>

<p>Tim Jones, Ferdinand Wagge, Billy Dawson, and
Bertram Kyndersley, reading this effusion behind their
shabby drapery of green baize which did duty for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
curtain, were mightily amused at the fellow-gipsies on
the highway of Art; and in the hope that the house
by the pine trees might at least be productive of decent
whisky and cigars, fervidly accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>“S’pose the postscript is her telegraphic address?”
hazarded Billy Dawson, knitting his brows. “More
like the ’phone number,” from Ferdinand Wagge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aureole, sparkling with the double consciousness
of having vindicated her Bohemianism, and
at the same time acted in a way which would thoroughly
annoy Stuart, was being championed by Letty and the
Cabbage-rose, against the disapproval of Archie Mowbray,
whose attitude was so consistently characteristic of the
British subaltern, as to be almost untrue to life.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t do, y’know. Really, Mrs. Strachey, it’s
deuced cheek of me to interfere, but to mix privately
with those singing <span class="lock">chaps&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“They’re as good as we are,” flashed Letty. And the
Cabbage-rose interpolated: “Of course they are, delightful
fellows! It was a splendid idea to invite them;
so unconventional; and I do so love their dear little
peepy masks. Do, Mr. Verney, go round again and beg
them not to change their costumes.”</p>

<p>The good-natured hunchback went, chuckling to
himself. On the way home&mdash;a taxi and Verney’s motor-car
proving sufficient to accommodate their own party
in mixed proportion with the four Troubadours&mdash;Aureole
had time to hope Stuart would be in bed. He was;
and so were all the remaining boarders, save Bertie and
the Ostend-Plage Girl, who were discovered in the
kitchen, drinking champagne and eating dressed crab.
This inspired Aureole with a fresh idea:</p>

<p>“Ye must spread your own feast,” she cried, medievally.
“Ransack cellars, larders and pantry, and bring
forth all ye find. Ho, revellers, to the groaning board!&mdash;We’ll
make a midnight picnic of it.”</p>

<p>Thereafter, a helter-skelter of laughter and rummag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>ing,
and clatter of forks on the flagged floor, and little
shrieks of delight from the Cabbage-rose, and an
occasional agonized: sh-sh-sh, from Aureole, fearing to
wake the more respectable portion of her household;
dreading the sudden appearance of Stuart, exquisite in
pyjamas and monocle, his face screwed into an expression
of formidable politeness; and his tone holding all
there was of Archie Mowbray’s insular disapproval, and,
in addition, a blend of “my husband’s friend,” a sound
man in diamonds, and the Balliol undergraduate,&mdash;all
of which traits had developed to the entire exclusion of
pirate and leprechaun, since he had taken over management
of the Farme.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Wagge went solemnly to and fro from the
cellar, each time a pair of bottles under his arm. Tim
Jones and Ethel Wynne collaborated over the mixing
of the mayonnaise salad. And Letty, finding a bowl
of cream, suddenly suggested a dish of fruit from the
kitchen-garden.</p>

<p>“Oh, splendid! there are dozens of late raspberries,
I saw them this morning. Dark? Never mind; I’ll
take my own light,” and laughing at the absurdity of
the notion, Aureole snatched a candle, and stepped out
into the garden, calling on someone to follow with a
plate.</p>

<p>The night was sultry and moonless, as the Troubadour
pursued the tremulous flicker of light across the shadowy
lawn, and through an archway cut into the wall. Beyond
lay an almost solid blackness; only the passage
of the candle to reveal on either side pale dangling
shapes of apple and pear: the orchard; thence a twisting
path that led round the conservatories to the fruit-garden.
He paused, opened a glass door ... the
answering gush of perfume crept into his veins, heavy
as a bee that sways in a foxglove. He had lost sight of
the woman’s figure in its gleaming sheath of satin&mdash;no,
there the prick of candle light, and there Aureole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
tempting enough as she swept the flame up and down
the line of raspberry canes; hair tumbled duskily
against her shining pallor of neck, eyes brilliant with
the search; body swaying towards her companion each
time she pattered the ripe crimson berries on to the plate.</p>

<p>“Can’t you come nearer? I’ve just dropped two
beauties,” reproachfully.</p>

<p>The Troubadour never resisted temptation. He
pressed forward between the bushes; slipped an arm
round her, murmured a caressing word, had kissed her
full on the lips before she was even aware of his movements.
With realization, she repelled the man swiftly.
Bertram was startled&mdash;let her go, a move very much
against his principles. The raspberries lay spilt on the
earth between them. Scorning to run, she walked by
his side, without speaking, back to the house. He was
amused, yet slightly indignant, at this unwonted response
to his gallantries: “After all, it isn’t as if she
were still in her teens!”&mdash;and Billy Dawson, observant
beggar, would notice the empty plate, and ask sly
questions. Aureole, her heart thudding like a drum,
and the blood raging at her lips where he had touched
them, was wondering how much it all meant to him?
What would be the outcome? Furiously angry, all of
a sudden, with Oliver, for not being at hand to protect
her from this type of outrage; furiously angry at the
loss of dignity implied by the bruised stung sensation
on her mouth,&mdash;mouth which nevertheless would persist
in curving dangerously, provocatively, at the corners.
... She laughed aloud, laughed contempt for her
husband, defiance at her ‘husband’s friend,’ laughed a
welcome to the temperament which had lain too long
between lavender.</p>

<p>Encouraged, Bertram kissed her again, quickly, before
they quitted the shadows of the orchard and Aureole
struck him, for his insolence, but mostly because she
wanted to see the hurt pride blaze in his Spanish eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and because she hoped he would try and strangle her
for the blow. She was avid of sensations this night.</p>

<p>“Oh Lord!” muttered Bertram, rather disconcerted.
Then, in tender reproach: “You spill my shillings, Lady
Auburn-hair, and you spill the raspberries, and now
you spill my blood, which isn’t redder than they&mdash;I
mean, less red....”</p>

<p>They re-entered the lit hall; Aureole glanced furtively
at his mouth, to see if his accusations were justified:
an infinitesimal dot of scarlet had welled on the lower
lip. But it was she, not he, who had tasted blood....</p>



<p class="tbpara">The next meeting between Aureole and Bertram happened
four days later, hot noontide, in one of the declivities
of the cliff that sloped so gently to the sea.
Bertram did not hesitate an instant at repeating his
offence. Sooth to say, he had almost forgotten it was a
repetition; had certainly forgotten the reception which
had met his previous overtures. He came to Aureole
as natural and fresh in gallantry as though she were
his first love for the first time seen. That this state of
mind could be at all possible, never occurred to the
woman, who herself forever playing with emotion, yet
most remarkably gave credit to the other party for a
fierce, lasting, and genuine passion. Assuming that the
man’s interim had been spent in brooding over his dismissal,
then what excellent courage, what doggedness
of persistence, nay, what true measure of desire he
showed in thus returning undaunted to the charge....
Aureole rebelled&mdash;continued to rebel&mdash;yielded. The
Troubadour was surprised by her acquiescence, into
fervour keener than he usually displayed in his passing
errantry of light love. They met again. And again.
Her vanity had been damaged by Stuart’s refusal to
‘come and play.’ If he had responded ever so slightly,
ever so harmlessly, instead of viewing her so determinedly
in the light of “rather a little fool, but Nigger’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
wife, so I s’pose I must do my best for her,”&mdash;who
knows, she might have kept out of mischief elsewhere;
but he had lashed her by his rigid imperturbability to a
very demon of defiance. The origin of her severance
from Oliver, her initiative in the matter, was for Aureole
completely lost in the mists of long-agone; she genuinely
viewed herself as a deserted wife, forlorn, neglected,
forgotten, her youth wasting to middle-age.... And
when a cloaked man, a masked man, comes along,
trolling gaily his ballads of love, is one to let him pass
for the sake of Oliver, forsooth? or because one is
frightened of Stuart Heron?</p>



<p class="tbpara">&mdash;“She called you Pierrot, and immediately you <em>were</em>
Pierrot!” thus had remarked Bertram’s daughter,
Peter, on a certain occasion when he had been endeavouring
to explain to her the incident of one Chavvy.
Equally, she might now have paraphrased the situation;
“She saw you a Troubadour, and immediately you
<em>were</em> a Troubadour!” Bertram could no more help
responding to suggestion, than mercury to the weather.
And he troubadoured most excellently; liked the rôle,
with its flavour of ripening vineyards, and southern
roads white in the sunshine; snatched intrigues of the
court, alternating with the careless give-and-take of
wayside kisses. It was picturesque, yet virile; and
altogether more suited to his years and girth than had
been Pierrot. He basked in Aureole’s admiration; her
abstinence from awkward questioning was a divine
trait in womankind; she was radiantly attractive in
this, her wilful leap towards the sun. Bertram loved
her; he was quite sure he did.</p>

<p>And she would not have been Aureole had she not
attached all importance to the trappings of her romance:
the delicious sense of secrecy and guilt; the elaborate
excuses enabling her to retire early to her room; thence
to slip out through the low side window, on to the cliff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to the belt of pine trees amidst whose lean and swaying
shadows the Troubadour would be waiting to keep
tryst, those nights when no performance took place at
the Pavilion Gardens. Yet more cunning machinations
were required to induce some of the boarding-house
party to attend the concerts of the quartette, that she
might sit there, among the vague people who had not
been held in his arms; and hear him sing for her&mdash;yes,
for her&mdash;his ballads of the tavern and the caravan and
the desert.</p>

<p>Once indeed, shattering her sense of his eternal
presence, he warbled gaily, as they paced the dark cliff
edge:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sister, my sister, O fleet sweet swallow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy way is long to the sun and south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, fulfilled of my heart’s desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shedding my song upon height, upon hollow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tawny body and sweet small mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feed the heart of the night with fire!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And she cried disappointedly:</p>

<p>“You mean, when summer is over, you will go to
your South?”</p>

<p>(South, where all Troubadours live!)</p>

<p>And he, unheeding that Thatch Lane lay on the
London and North-Western Railway, gave careless
acquiescence. “I never stop long in any one place.
We are birds of passage, Lady Auburn-hair, and when
summer is over we will sing our songs in other lands.”</p>

<p>We? Our?&mdash;so what had been to her a thrilling pastime,
he, deluded Troubadour, had actually meant?
He had been building dreams of continuing their golden
idyll in other lands? Aureole replied, in curiously
vibrant tones:</p>

<p>“Once&mdash;I struck you&mdash;for suggesting&mdash;less than
that.”</p>

<p>Bertram, still humming, could not remember what
was the direful suggestion he had just inadvertently let
fall; but supposing it to have been for a caress, as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
usually his demands, he merely stated with a mirthless
laugh&mdash;not caring to risk again the sting of Aureole’s
little fingers:</p>

<p>“Then I must continue to exist without,&mdash;somehow,”
added in a lower tone of pain.</p>

<p>Aureole had since three years been striving to teach
Oliver this language, which came so naturally to the
man beside her. To “work up a scene” with her
husband had held as much&mdash;or as little&mdash;intoxication,
as going to a ball, in a blouse and skirt, at eleven o’clock
of a November morning. Aureole had an insatiable
greed for ‘powerful’ scenes; she took dalliance seriously,
inasmuch as she always saw herself as a coquette
with a heart of stone, scratching at hearts of flesh to
see how they bled. “I’m a beast!” she that night
adjured her image in the looking-glass&mdash;since without a
looking-glass impassioned monologues sound never very
convincing. “Oh, I <em>am</em> a beast. I don’t care a damn
for him, and he thinks I do care; he thinks I’m&mdash;coming.”
During the month of September, the vision of
her Troubadour, a lonely swallow to the South, became
almost too poignant to be born.</p>

<p>Summer was dropping her days as faintly and imperceptibly
as the first faintly yellowing leaves from the
trees. A sense of depression, of the closing-down of the
year, drifted over the Farme. Some of the visitors were
leaving; as entities they did not matter; but as a
symbol of evanescence, their departure affected Aureole
with profound melancholy. The Troubadour Quartette
sang no more of an evening in the Pavilion Gardens.
Bertram rented a room in the town, and lingered on;
but at any moment, she felt, the call of the South might
peal too clearly for him; and then, with or without her,
he too would depart.</p>

<p>With or without her.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Climax was heralded by poisoned fish....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuart went nearly every day now to his business
in High Holborn, returning to Bournemouth in time for
dinner in the evening. On a certain Friday, he was
met in the hall by the Cabbage-rose, who informed him
in sprightly tones:</p>

<p>“We shall be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> for dinner to-night, Mr.
Heron.”</p>

<p>On the grounds that some things are too bad to be
true, Stuart did not at once grasp the prospect:</p>

<p>“Where’s everybody, then?”</p>

<p>“All ill!” announced the Cabbage-rose triumphantly;
and some of her evening-dress fell off.</p>

<p>“All?”</p>

<p>“My poor Johnny has been terribly bad, and so has
Mrs. Percival. And, if you listen, you will hear Sir James
groaning. There was mackerel for breakfast this morning,
and it can’t have been quite good. I took a boiled
egg, and you, of course, had gone off to town before the
fish came, so you see we are sole survivors!” she adjusted
a slippery shoulder-strap, and trilled with laughter
at the compromising situation.&mdash;Then her face fell, as
she spied the Disagreeable Female marching down the
stairs.</p>

<p>“I’m better. Not well, but better. I’ve had no food
and no attention all day, so I trust there’s a substantial
dinner. Good evening, Mr. Heron; I wish to complain
of the fish we had for breakfast to-day. We’ve all
been seriously indisposed. One has to eat mackerel or
nothing, because there was only one egg, and naturally
we couldn’t <em>all</em> have that,” and here she glared at the
Cabbage-rose. “I believe I am voicing the dissatisfaction
of all the visitors here, Mr. Heron, when I say
that I consider it your duty to be at home during the
day to control these matters.&mdash;Ah! there is the gong,
thank goodness. Even if you are running a second
boarding establishment in London, it can hardly warrant
neglect of us. Please pass the potatoes. I am bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
say that matters were improved during the fortnight
you had entire control.”</p>

<p>Stuart bowed: “You overwhelm me.”</p>

<p>“Mustard, please. And as for Mrs. Strachey, I cannot
say she ever struck me as a very competent person;
but since she spends her days running about with that
very disreputable beach-performer&mdash;in my time they
blacked their faces, so that one might know they weren’t
gentlemen,&mdash;she has let everything go to rack and
ruin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he’s hardly what you’d call a nigger,” put
in the Cabbage-rose. “He has one of those nice olive
complexions, you know; and he has sung before all
the crowned heads of Europe. Certainly, dear Mrs.
Strachey is making herself rather <span class="lock">conspicuous&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>But the Disagreeable Female continued stonily: “I
am purposely calling your attention to the scandal,
Mr. Heron, as if she is also deceiving you, who pass
yourself off as her husband’s <span class="lock">friend&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Pardon me, I <em>am</em> her husband’s friend. And both
he and I have implicit confidence in Mrs. Strachey’s
choice of acquaintances; so that there’s no need at all
for scandal. If you’ve any more complaints to make
about the <em>food</em>, I shall be pleased to listen.”</p>

<p>The Disagreeable Female, quelled for the moment,
merely suggested that Stuart should bring two dozen
eggs every day from London, as they seemed to be
scarce in Bournemouth “And not fresh. We <em>all</em> like
eggs,” and again her eye roamed towards the Cabbage-rose.</p>

<p>But in spite of his championship of Aureole, Stuart’s
principles of morality were severely outraged by this
account of her flirtation. Defiance of the standing social
and domestic code, was in his eyes only permissible to
what he termed free-lance adventurers, like himself,
Peter, or Sebastian. But Aureole was a wife; and,
moreover, his pal’s wife. Running about all day with&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
organ-grinder, was it? It would not be too much
to state that Heron of Balliol, Heron of Heron &amp; Carr,
was genuinely shocked.&mdash;“It isn’t done!” Besides
which, he had obstinately determined that Aureole
should eventually be handed over, as far as possible
undamaged, to her husband. He had written several
letters to Oliver, at the latter’s bank and office, hoping
that either of these would receive an address to which
to forward correspondence. Pending his arrival,
Aureole must be kept spotless as snow. Very worried
at the new development in his responsibilities, Stuart
tackled her the following evening:</p>

<p>“How are the invalids? Anybody dead?”</p>

<p>“They’re all up, except Mr. Johnson. He had it
worst. Stuart, will I have to pay the doctor for all of
them? The old cat says I’m liable.” The old cat was
the Disagreeable Female.</p>

<p>“Indeed you are. Why don’t you examine fish when
it comes in?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for the smell. I ... just don’t care
for it. And I was out.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>Aureole smiled; a slow mutinous smile. “You grow
more like Oliver every day.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” quoth Stuart virtuously; “he’s a better
man than I am. Wouldn’t it be as well to see in future
that your guests aren’t poisoned as well as starved?”</p>

<p>“Dear man, it would bore me.”</p>

<p>He strove to be moderate: “Quite so. But you’ve
only five weeks still to run here, and confound it,
Aureole! surely it’s more fun to get through a stodgy
job decently and with credit, than just bungle it. Even
if you hate it, it’s more fun.”</p>

<p>“Our ideas of fun differ,” she laughed, impenitent.
And then Stuart realized with horror that she was
looking remarkably pretty. He knew enough of neurotic
women to be assured that they did not sparkle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
bloom unless danger was imminent. He did not know
enough of them to refrain from making a mistake in his
next remark:</p>

<p>“I’ve reason to believe your husband will be here
shortly. He won’t be over-pleased to fork out, among
other things, for thirteen doctor’s bills on attending
thirteen bilious attacks.”</p>

<p>“Damn doctors!” she stamped her foot viciously.
“Damn bilious attacks and fish and boarding-houses
and husbands and ... and you....” She fled to
Bertram, awaiting her among the pines. A soft drizzling
moisture filled the air. In the garden she passed Sebastian
and Letty, whose mission it seemed to leave
themselves lying about to act as goads in critical moments.&mdash;“Damn
lovers....”</p>

<p>&mdash;“Lady Auburn-hair, this is almost our good-bye.
In a very few <span class="lock">days&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“You must go? Is that it?” the chill in the air
crept into her very soul.</p>

<p>“Not that I must go, but that I must not stay,”
parried Bertram, skilfully implying unutterable things.
Sooth to say, he was weary of troubadouring.</p>

<p>South ... South ... he on his lonely voyage to
the sun; and she remaining to examine fish at the
door ... colder drearier days ... Oliver coming back
to scold her ... other lovers, two and two and two
... and romance, masked and cloaked, abandoning
her for ever?...</p>

<p>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti scordar di me!</span>” he throbbed forth suddenly,
in his passionate tenor. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti scordar di me!</span>”</p>

<p>And Aureole replied: “Ask me again, Troubadour, as
you asked me once ... and perhaps&mdash;perhaps I will
come with you.”</p>



<p class="tbpara">After her departure, Bertram still sat on the damp
bench beneath the trees, gazing helplessly before him.
He found himself pledged, he knew not how, and, ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
days hence, he knew not why, to a journey South, he
knew not where. He believed he had been guilty of
describing, in vivid spirited narrative, some such adventure
across the water; because&mdash;deuce take it!
with the reputation of a troubadour, a traveller, a
pedlar of songs, a lover of fair women, a comrade of
lords and beggars alike, he could hardly leave acquiescence
at a tame: “Yes. Let’s. How jolly,” when she
proposed their hazardous plunge together into the
unknown. Well, he had still, as result of a successful
summer tour, some thirty odd pounds in his pocket,
and a store of faithful attachment in his heart. As to
their ultimate destiny, when love and the thirty pounds
were exhausted,&mdash;that was a problem too deep for a
mazed troubadour, sitting disconsolately beneath a
dripping pine tree. Floating in the vague backwaters
of his mind was the supposition that, at worst, he could
always take Aureole to Miss Esther Worthing&mdash;his
sister-in-law&mdash;and leave her there. After all, Esther
had made Chavvy very welcome. Meanwhile ...
Bertram’s inflammable heart had certainly landed him
in some awkward situations of late; he didn’t know what
women were coming to, when one willy-nilly married
you, and another ran away with you! He wondered if
it would ever be his lot to meet with a nice modest girl,
content with a few kisses and endearments; a girl like
his daughter Peter!</p>

<p>&mdash;“Lord! I wonder what Peter would say to this
mess. <em>When</em> did I promise? <em>What</em> did I ask? I’m
hanged if I can remember....”</p>



<p class="tbpara">Stuart came to the conclusion that it was no good
plunging into this affair before it had reached its zenith.
Just at present there was nothing to get at. It was best
as rapidly as possible to hasten the ultimate climax,
which he strongly believed would be a romantic elopement,
and then, somehow, smash it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>So, in furtherance of these plans, he came to Aureole;
and meekly, as though in atonement for his former
surliness, placed his sailing-yacht at the disposal of
herself and her visitors.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought it over from the Haven, and it’s lying
anchored at the foot of the Chine. If at any time you
care to use it, old Dan Truefitt will act skipper; he’s
perfectly trustworthy; and he has my orders.”</p>

<p>It struck Aureole how delightfully ironical it would
be to employ Stuart’s boat&mdash;just Stuart’s boat&mdash;for the
means of transport, when she and Bertram escaped from
the old to the new. At present, her chiefest joy in the
prospect of the elopement, was in contemplating
Stuart’s reception of the tidings. And if the latter
should come to him flavoured by the final audacity of
<em>his</em> property as the vehicle of sin&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>“Thank you, Stuart,” demurely; “it’s very thoughtful
of you; and it’s so difficult, now that the real summer
weather is over, to keep everyone amused. We play
coon-can, of course. But there’s something more virile
about sailing, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Much more virile,” he agreed. And wondered if his
bait had been swallowed. At all events, he must assume
it had. He calculated that the pair would not make
their flight by day, both for practical reasons of concealment,
and from a sense of atmosphere. On the
other hand, Aureole would scarcely wait for the arrival
of her ‘gaoler’ from town, by the 7.40 train every
evening. Between six and seven, then, the twilight
hour, he fixed as the time when two cloaked figures
might be expected at the foot of the Chine, where the
boat lay at anchor. At this spot, therefore, in the shadow
of the cliff, Stuart waited secretly, patiently, every
evening between six and seven o’clock. Baldwin demanded
frequently why he left the office so early; and
confided to Arthur Heron that he believed Stuart to be
mixed up in “some affair with a woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;“Would you advise me to move in the matter?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Uncle Arthur, always inclined to be
taciturn.</p>

<p>“Not find out who she is? and call on the female?
and attempt to square her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well then, shall I tackle Stuart? Remind him
what he owes to the name? Set forth, from experience,
how helpless a young fellow can be in the hands of a
clever adventuress? Tell <span class="lock">him&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>This time the other man answered at greater length:
“My God, no.”</p>

<p>And Baldwin left it at that.</p>

<p>“I should say it would be very soon now,” reflected
Stuart, on the ninth day of waiting. This he deduced
from Aureole’s demeanour; she being quite incapable
of restraining herself from inscrutable smiles, eyes
dream-laden, spurts of brilliantly hectic conversation,
bouts of feverish consideration for others, speech and
comment pregnant with triple meanings, and other
indications of a swiftly approaching crisis; all of which
Stuart found extremely useful. He had no notion of
exactly how he was to effect the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle</i>, but trusted
for his inspiration to that solemn moment when, about
to embark, the guilty couple should hear the shuffle of
footsteps in the sand, and, turning, gaze into his accusing
eyes.... “Is this prophetic sight, or did I ever read
about it?” mused Stuart.</p>

<p>He paid Aureole the compliment of not for a moment
believing that she was taking her fun all this while in a
squalid furtive fashion, attempting to blend outward
respectability with hidden romance. No; decidedly
she had the courage of her emotional caprices; this had
been proved by her prompt flight from Norfolk, directly
she had convinced herself that it was necessary for her
soul’s development and for the stimulation of Oliver’s
after-marriage courtship.&mdash;“She’ll burn her boats right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
enough&mdash;little fool!” Stuart muttered; “and I hope
it will be to-night.” He was beginning to find his
shadowy watches both wearisome and chilly.</p>



<p class="tbpara">“But, sweetheart, I <em>can’t</em> sail a yacht,” cried the
Troubadour in despair, when Aureole unfolded her
latest scheme.</p>

<p>“You can row, then; and we’ll reef the sails&mdash;tie
them up in a bundle. It’s a pity ... but yet ... plash
of oars on the calm still water....”</p>

<p>Bertram hoped it would indeed be calm still water.
He did not care to disturb her imagination by mere
facts,&mdash;but he had no liking for the sea. He asked if he
were expected to row all the way to France, to Provence,
golden land of minstrelsy, which she had chosen as their
first background for unending and virile scenes of love.</p>

<p>Aureole sighed. “It’s a pity,” she repeated. “However,
we’ll row along the coast to Poole, and hire a man,
a strange fierce-eyed man, to sail the boat across the
Channel. And then, after landing us, he shall sail her
back again”&mdash;and she added, in a vicious undertone,&mdash;“to
Stuart Heron!”</p>



<p class="tbpara">To Stuart Heron, crouching far back in an indentation
hollowed out of the cliff, the events of that night were
swift and improbable as scenes reeled off the film. The
white line of wave hissed and broke with exactly that
sound; and the twilight had sucked the background of
all colour save lifeless greys; clearly etched against the
pale sky, rose the mainmast of the boat; beside it, the
tall figure of a man stood immovable, wrapped in heavy
folds of cloak, his face blurred by the deepening shadows.
The white line of wave hissed and broke. Then, quite
tiny at first, but gradually growing to life-size, a woman’s
figure fled down the winding road of the Chine. The
man stepped forward to meet her, held her for a moment
silently in his arms, then drew her along the shore to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the boat. They gesticulated with sharp little movements.
Another figure stole out of hiding; crept towards
the couple, whose backs were turned to him. His
steps were noiseless on the sand. So that still no sound
shattered the picture, save of the white line of wave
that monotonously hissed and broke....</p>

<p>All this, Stuart watched with mingled amusement and
interest. His was the stealthy shape which might have
been a spy among conspirators, a Customs Officer amid
smugglers, an Indian with a tomahawk, or the hero to
the rescue.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then he spoke, casually:</p>

<p>“Going for a sail? Can I be of any use?”</p>

<p>Aureole did not shriek. She swayed slightly, recovered
herself, looked at the intruder steadily, and said: “You
... beast!”</p>

<p>He smiled. “Oh, yes, I think the breeze is strong
enough.” Then he turned to meet full-face the eyes of&mdash;Bertram
Kyndersley. “You? the devil!”</p>

<p>Bertram betrayed no surprise at the sudden apparition.
He was already a stricken man this night. Aureole’s
wishes he had carried out in a dazed mazed sort of
fashion, still not sure how he came to be involved in
this medieval escapade. He had eloped before; but
sensibly,&mdash;never like this. He was just aware that for
one who had troubadoured not wisely but too well,
there were no honourable means of withdrawal. Wondering
whether for the rest of his life he would be doomed
to carry a guitar, without its case, exposed to the
mockery of all men; whether, once at sea, he would
ever again be able to induce a demoniacal boat shorewards;
whether his little store of gold would vanish
in a single night, and leave him a beggar in Provence;
wondering all this, he yet acquiesced to his fate; and
even, when the string was pulled, said: “Lady Auburn-hair,”
passionately, and added a few lyrical snatches
expressive of his enamoured condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>So that Stuart Heron, from whom he remembered
once borrowing ten pounds in the garden of Bloemfontein,
now took his place quite naturally as part of
the scenery imported by Aureole; for what purpose
Bertram knew not, and cared not; while things were
happening to him, they might as well happen one way
as another. And when Stuart, having unroped the boat,
said: “Would you mind sitting to windward, Mr.
Kyndersley?” then he obediently sat in the spot indicated,
beside Aureole; and alternately watched
Stuart in a deft manipulation of sheets, and the waves
that split in a white lather of fury along the bows.</p>

<p>“Not the weather I’d have chosen to take you for a
pleasure-trip,” remarked the skipper to his passengers,
when he had finally got her running with dangerous
speed before the wind. “However&mdash;&mdash;” he shrugged
his shoulders, implying it was their choice, not his.</p>

<p>Presently a silence fell upon Bertram, different from
the numb passivity of his bearing hitherto; a more
pregnant sort of silence, eloquent of a thousand words
unspoken....</p>

<p>“Care to smoke?” enquired Stuart, with brutal
courtesy. He made fast the sheet, and lit a cigarette.
Then, ruthlessly, held the shielded flame for Bertram;
that instant of light showed him&mdash;many things!
All his previous indignation with Aureole was now
shifted to Aureole’s partner in crime: Bertram Kyndersley&mdash;who
was a father&mdash;Peter’s father&mdash;Why, the
man must be an arrant scoundrel! Aureole, Stuart
observed thankfully, dumb with scorn and hatred and
apprehension, was yet being spared the worst; she was
a good sailor. Hitherto she had bravely maintained
the pretence that this was merely a delightful half-hour’s
excursion on the water; but now she leant forward,
and demanded tensely:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with us?”</p>

<p>“Where were you bound for?” replied Stuart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does that matter ... now?”&mdash;a guitar slid suddenly
between them, fallen from a limp hand, and
bounded against the rail.</p>

<p>Stuart said, eyes fixed upon the slant of the sail:
“This man has a wife.” His speech was bound to be
curt, for the increasing wind broke up every sentence as
it fell from the salt-stiff lips, and tossed the words
sportively hither and thither.</p>

<p>“This man has a wife.”</p>

<p>“It’s not true!” cried Aureole.</p>

<p>And Bertram muttered something about “man to
man” and “code of honour”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, honour!” Stuart did some malicious act which
caused the bows to dip slowly into the trough of a wave,
then suddenly rear, and roll over sideways with a
lurch; “why should I be bound in honour to uphold
you in your dishonourable acts, because you happen
to be of my sex? Where’s your honour where Chavvy
is concerned? little Chavvy, yours by right of England’s
sacred laws, and by her unwavering love! It’s
men like you,” continued Stuart Heron, “who wreck
the sanctity of the home and violate the sanctity of the
heart”&mdash;seeing that Bertram was perforce not attending
to his eloquent harangue, he addressed himself to
Aureole: “I’ve told you the truth, Aureole; and I
can prove it to be the truth. You’ve come into his arms
only over the body of another woman. Even now, she’s
waiting patiently for his return; she&mdash;damn! the wind’s
changed!” ... and only just in time the sheet was
unlashed and pulled in.... “About ship!” he roared.
Aureole obeyed instantly; but Bertram, not at home in
nautical phraseology, had to be lugged forcibly from the
drenched scuppers.</p>

<p>Stuart went on: “And, in the same way, brutally,
remorselessly, he would desert you, when he got tired of
the episode; and you would be stranded, an outcast
from respectability, a derelict of life, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
single fighting weapon left; your looks raddled and
faded”&mdash;he felt he might as well pile it on while he
was about it,&mdash;“no money, no hope, your husband
alienated, your faith shattered,&mdash;all for the sake of a
man who should be labelled <em>dangerous!</em> for everyone
with whom he comes in contact, to see and
beware!”</p>

<p>A ray of moon pierced the drifting clouds, and showed
him Aureole, huddled on the seat, a woebegone little
figure, with wisps of soaked veil and hair blown flat
on to her pinched white face; not a trace left of the
flare and defiant glow with which she had started on
her pursuit of love <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> troubadour. And he became
suddenly human, and very sorry for her, and rather
embarrassed at his former rant and rhetoric.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear; we’re tacking landwards now;
and not a soul need ever know the facts of this. If anyone
asks, you’ve been for a spin with a tomfool skipper
who didn’t know dirty weather when he saw it. I
expect Mr. Kyndersley can be trusted to keep his mouth
shut,” with a scathing glance at the second of the romantic
pair, who, at the moment, was emphatically not fulfilling
these expectations.</p>

<p>They landed at the same spot where they had previously
embarked. Stuart was eager to get Aureole
home; he saw she was on the verge of a breakdown;
and recognizing perhaps the new note of solicitude and
pity in his tones, she seemed to cling to him. Without
a word of farewell, they left Bertram standing on the
shore; carrying in one hand a smashed guitar, with
the other hand striving to gather closer about his shivering
figure, the sodden folds of his cloak. It was not
till his two companions were finally gulped by the
darkness, as they passed up the winding road of the
Chine, that his bewildered consciousness was slowly
illumined by recognition of his freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you have any luggage?” Stuart demanded of
Aureole, as he supported her up the drive of the Farme.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes; only a small bag; it’s still in the boat.”</p>

<p>“Then what&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Bertram was going to buy me all I wanted.”</p>

<p>Stuart wondered if his ten-pound note, as well as his
boat, was to have been pressed into service for the
elopement.</p>

<p>They found the hall deserted; from behind the dining-room
door could be heard sounds indicative of dinner
progressing within.</p>

<p>“Excellent; nobody need see you; go up to your
room, and put on something dry; and I’ll have hot soup
sent up to you, and tell them to light you a fire.”</p>

<p>Aureole bestowed on him a wan smile of gratitude,
and droopingly went upstairs. Stuart gave the necessary
orders; then, not caring either to join the rest of
the company, or change his wet clothes, remained
fidgeting restlessly about the hall. Like Bertram, he
was feeling “strangely disturbed in his innards,” though
from different causes. Bertram ... how diabolically
the man’s eyes, in spite of the puffiness beneath, had
recalled Peter’s.... “Infernal old reprobate!” muttered
Stuart; “one would think he might have a sense
of decency, with a grown-up daughter.”</p>

<p>Peter ... Stuart swore softly as he meandered from
staircase to window, from dining-room door to front door.</p>

<p>Presently the latter opened, and Oliver Strachey
walked in.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Nigger!”</p>

<p>“Hullo. Where’s my wife?”</p>

<p>“In her room,” replied Stuart, with deep inner
thankfulness that this should be so.</p>

<p>“Which room?” Oliver prepared to mount.</p>

<p>“First floor, second on the left. And go easy;
she’s a bit nervous to-night; I took her for a sail, and
it upset her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“So I should think; in this weather. What a crazy
old slogger you are! Your first letter was forwarded
to me ages ago; so, knowing Aureole was all right with
you, I stopped on in New York, and did some business.”</p>

<p>“Um.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Second door on the left.”</p>

<p>Oliver ran up the stairs, two at a time, and vanished.</p>

<p>“Nice old mess-up it might have been, but for me,”
reflected Stuart complacently. “And I wonder if that’s
going to be something on my credit side of the ledger,
at last. <em>Who</em> pulled ’em out?&mdash;little Tommy Stout!”</p>

<p>&mdash;But who put ’em in?... Stuart remembered
suddenly his debit account; and ceased to crow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A sad little Pierrette crouched in front of the fire.
Pierrot had gone away. Would he ever come back?
Pierrette had waited so long.</p>

<p>The wind lashed and sobbed at the windows. Up the
street crept the solitary figure of a man. Outside the
house he paused, cast away a phantom cloak and mask&mdash;(oh,
the infinite relief!) and donned a phantom skull
cap and white frill. Metamorphosis easily effected.</p>

<p>Pierrette opened to the knock at the door. And, with
a cry of joy, held out both hands to welcome in the
truant.</p>

<p>“I knew you would come home, Pierrot,” quoth
Chavvy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">WORSHIPPERS ALL</span></h3>


<p>The end of September saw the Johnsons back
again in their Turnham Green residence,
named, somewhat misleadingly: “Town House.”
Thus it was an easy matter for Mr. Johnson to
say, wherever he might chance to spend his summer
holidays: “Mother, this time next week we’ll be in our
Town House!” airily creating out of his harmless little
vanity, a whole host of shooting-boxes, country mansions,
river bungalows, and Riviera villas. Mrs. Johnson
would smile tolerantly; she encouraged originality,
even in her husband.</p>

<p>Sebastian Levi took a room near by, where he wrote
the final chapters of his book, and impatiently awaited
the return of Stuart from Bournemouth, that the whole
might receive his sanction and benediction. A fortnight
afterwards, and he was summoned one evening to
Carlton House Terrace; and in an apartment which
was curiously ordinary for the shrine of so exalted a
being, found Stuart sprawling in a low shabby arm-chair,
and poking at the smouldering coals with his
foot.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Levi, how’s&mdash;let me see, I’ve forgotten the
<span class="lock">name&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“‘Shears,’” supplemented Sebastian excitedly;
“I’ve got it with me.”</p>

<p>“No, you ardent flame-headed lover. Letty. How’s
Letty?”</p>

<p>“Letty’s all right, except the days when she has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
starve herself to make her father receive me. I say,
Heron,” looking about him, “what a queer sort of room&mdash;for
you.”</p>

<p>“What’s queer about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, mainly that it isn’t queer at all, I suppose; it
might be anybody’s study.” And Sebastian thought
with a smothered sigh, of the suite of apartments he
had renounced in his father’s house in Hampstead. He
had attained so exactly the effects his artistic eye
desired, beautiful subdued effects of lighting and
drapery. Editha and Ivy had been nothing like as
successful in their more blatant furnishings.</p>

<p>“What do chairs and tables matter?” queried
Stuart calmly.</p>

<p>“But don’t you want to impress your personality&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“On a firescreen? no, I’d choose something softer
than that.” But though a gleam in Stuart’s eye betokened
plainly what was the “something softer” he
had chosen, Sebastian, turning over the leaves of his
precious manuscript, and awaiting a desirable opening
to introduce it into the conversation, noticed nothing.</p>

<p>“How’s the Menagerie? Have you left it to muddle
on by itself?”</p>

<p>“No; Mr. Strachey returned from America last
week, and I resigned management. I don’t think he
was keen on bearing the burden, but they’ve only got
the place for a month still.”</p>

<p>“Is Aureole very fond of him?” Sebastian wondered
in a fever of impatience when Stuart was going to ask
him about “Shears.”</p>

<p>Stuart smiled, as at some secret joke. “Just at
present she’s the very model of a meek and devoted
wife.” Then, at last, held out his hand towards the
bundle on Sebastian’s knees. “Finished? Let’s have
a look?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I say&mdash;if it won’t bother you&mdash;&mdash;” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Stuart was already at the first page, on which was
inscribed the dedication:</p>

<div class="center">
“To<br />
<span class="smcap">Stuart Heron</span><br />
In thanks<br />
For all that he took from me<br />
And all that he gave to me.”<br />
</div>

<p>He threw the young author an embarrassed look.
“I don’t know, really, that I did take anything; you
flung down,&mdash;that’s rather different.”</p>

<p>“I’m flinging down now&mdash;this book!” cried Sebastian,
much happier than his companion when emotion
was to the fore. “It’s yours, every line of it; your
thoughts, your creed, your visions and ideals. It’s&mdash;well,
I owed you something really big, and this was the
best I could do. The very best.” His tone pleaded,
but at the same time boasted his achievement.</p>

<p>Stuart began to read. Presently it dawned upon
him that this was a very bad book. The style, at first,
held recollections of Sebastian’s Oxford days; it
echoed, somewhat pretentiously, the polished laboured
phrasing of Walter Pater. Then, uncertainly, it began
to jerk and flicker; to pass from one key into another;
to offend by a great many flaunting passages of which
the writer was obviously proudest. It soon became
apparent that the hero, a flashy young man in the worst
possible taste, was intended for a loving presentment
of Stuart himself, drawn by a blind worshipper, and
consequently now giving the writhing original a few of
the most poignant moments he had ever thought to
endure.</p>

<p>“My God!” he muttered once or twice.</p>

<p>Moreover, Sebastian had apparently just fallen short
of the main idea&mdash;idea of the Shears and the Hairpin
Vision; glimpsed it at moments and then lost it again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
so that it carried no conviction, and was merely far-fetched
and misty.</p>

<p>In short, when he had turned twenty pages, Stuart
would have given much never to have owned a creed,
nor yet a disciple; that he should live to see the one so
perverted, and the other sitting opposite him with
dumbly questioning gaze. “Well? ... well? ...” it
seemed to say.</p>

<p>Stuart laid aside the scribbled-over sheets. “I can’t
possibly go on reading while you sit there and hang out
your tongue at me, Levi; I’m not strong-minded
enough. You’d better leave the book behind for me to
finish.”</p>

<p>And so, cravenly, he postponed the evil hour of
criticism. And afterwards wrote a letter which was a
diplomatic miracle; ending:</p>

<p>&mdash;“You will understand that the book and all it
contains has affected me more profoundly than I can
express in words&mdash;just yet. Perhaps when it is published,
and I can get a better perspective, I shall be
able to say more of what I feel....”</p>

<p>Not having seen the vicious contortions of Stuart’s
features as he penned these sentences, Sebastian was
for the nonce satisfied.&mdash;“When it is published”&mdash;how
devoutly he longed for this consummation of his labours.
To lay at Stuart’s feet a pile of scribbled paper was
comparatively nothing; but to be the means of spreading
the master’s word throughout the British Isles, in a
bound volume of sturdy print, containing the master’s
name at the beginning, for all to reverence and comment
upon,&mdash;this, surely, was a worthy tribute, sufficient
to win the “well done!” that the disciple so burningly
coveted. Sebastian’s desire to publish was completely
unselfish; he was proud of his book only inasmuch as
it reflected Stuart; thirsted for fame merely that the
rays might fall on Stuart’s head. The utmost he wished
for himself was sufficient recognition of the Vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Splendid, that men might say, men and his father and
the Johnsons: “I thought young Levi mad at the
time, to have chucked such excellent worldly prospects;
but now I marvel how right he was, how much clearer
was his sight than ours, how quickly responsive was his
soul to what has taken us three-hundred-and-sixteen
pages of solid reading to recognize!”... He could not
quite hear Mr. Johnson uttering these precise words,
but a homely vernacular would be forgiven for the sake
of lofty sentiment. At present Sebastian was only
received at Town House on sufferance; and trifling
matters, such as the parlour left empty for him and
Letty during four hours or so, were not arranged as
willingly as might have been the case had the young
man still been in possession of his fifteen hundred a
year. Letty herself, however, compensated him richly
for her parents’ unkindness. She grew ever prettier,
ever more yielding, ever more necessary for Sebastian’s
peace of mind and body. Ned Levi’s humble birth and
ancestry had implanted a strain in the boy which found
curious pleasure in his fiancée’s slightly common turn
of phrase, her occasional lack of refinement in taste and
clothes, her childish unpretentious longings, her tiny
little vulgarisms. These were never sufficiently strident
to jar him; they merely gave him a sense of returning
to rest after a long journey; cessation of a cry in him
that no riches or dissipations or intellectual strivings
could ever thus lull to silence. Moreover, Letty clung
to him; and he knew she believed herself clinging to a
rock; supposition soothing to his own inner doubts.</p>

<p>The one thing in her that puzzled him was her continual
reference to a near future when, as a matter of
course, they should be as wealthy as before his renunciation
of wealth. It could not be that she depended for
this on his book, which, he had explained to her many
times, was not a money-making proposition. And once,
when he had laughingly asked if she proposed robbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Aladdin’s Cave or the Bank of England, for the fulfilment
of her plans, she laid both hands on his shoulders,
and demanded wistfully:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you sure <em>yet</em>, Sebastian?”</p>

<p>“Sure of what, sweetheart?”</p>

<p>She sighed, and turned away her head. Perhaps he
had decided for a year-long test; if so, she must just be
patient.&mdash;The door opened to admit Mrs. Johnson and
Mrs. Baker, mother of that Violet who even now contemplated
breaking off her engagement because Letty’s
Sebastian had ‘a lovely mouth and jaw,’ and her own
Ernie a receding chin. But Mrs. Baker bore no malice
for this; her nature was soft as sponge, and formless as
the garments which dripped and cascaded from indiscriminately
outjutting portions of her figure; garments
without end or beginning; rather dirty garments, of a
period unknown to history.</p>

<p>“Disturbin’ your billing and cooing, are we?” she
cried genially; “there, it’s a shame! But I only
wanted to be introduced to your friend, Letty, my dear.”
She beamed on Sebastian, noted at once that he was a
Jew, and kindly resolved not to mention the fact that
her late husband had been a parson. Then she changed
her mind, and instead of tactfully skirting the subject
of Sebastian’s misfortune&mdash;which, poor boy, was probably
an accident and not his fault&mdash;she decided to refer
to It exactly as if It didn’t matter, and thus put him
entirely at his ease. So she started:</p>

<p>“And where are these young folk going to have the
knot tied, Frances Johnson? At a registrar’s, I suppose,&mdash;as
it can’t be done in Church. So nice ... dear
things ...” wheezily.</p>

<p>Letty and her mother looked at one another. “Now
that’s funny!” exclaimed Mrs. Johnson; “I never
thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Thought of what?” asked Sebastian.</p>

<p>“Why, that you couldn’t be married in a church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“But a Synagogue is a sweet place,” put in Mrs.
Baker; “though of course it wouldn’t do for Letty.
But I’m sure the Hebrew ceremony is beautiful, even if
one can’t understand a word of it, because they pronounce
it upside down, don’t they? I remember going
once to see a Jewish girl we knew get married; such a
good-looking girl ... dear thing ... Laura Silberstein;
did you know her, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Levi,” supplemented Sebastian gravely, wishing it
had been something worse.</p>

<p>“And I remember too that the white flowers and the
satin tent and that lovely singing made me feel&mdash;I told
Mr. Baker afterwards&mdash;quite as religious and miserable as
if I’d been to one of our own weddings. And he had no
objection at all, and said I might certainly go again
every time the younger sisters married; there were
eight Silberstein girls, you see. And he told me to take
Violet next time. Mr. Baker liked us always to be nice
to Jews; he was very particular about that.”</p>

<p>Sebastian had a happy moment picturing Mr. Baker
being particular about it. He was sorry Mr. Baker
was dead.</p>

<p>“And did the other seven poor girls get married?”
Letty enquired earnestly, very sorry for them because
they could not all or any marry Sebastian.</p>

<p>“Only one; Pearl, the youngest; and she married a
High Church gentleman, and got quickly baptised, and
it was held at St. George’s, Hanover Square. And that
time,” Mrs. Baker concluded triumphantly, “my
husband would <em>not</em> let me attend. He said Jews were
delightful and clever people <em>in</em> their faith, but disapproved
of them marrying out of it.”</p>

<p>... Then she realized the horror of her mistake.</p>

<p>Letty slipped her fingers into Sebastian’s arm, and
looked defiantly at the purpling Mrs. Baker. Mrs.
Johnson said hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Of course they are quite wonderfully clever; such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a head for business. That’s why we’re so sorry, Sebastian,
that you gave up your partnership at the Stores.”</p>

<p>“What is Mr. Levi doing then?” queried Mrs. Baker
faintly. And Letty trumpeted forth that Sebastian had
written a book.</p>

<p>“Oh, but then he must have quite wonderful brains;
now I like that; yes, I like people to have brains...
dear things ...” and Mrs. Baker nodded and smiled
several times to show her tolerance, while, in the same
key, Mrs. Johnson carried on:</p>

<p>“Yes, I must say that personally I don’t object to
even a woman with a man’s brain; we hear a lot about
it spoiling her charm, but <em>I</em> think a girl can be both
feminine and intellectual, don’t you, Milly?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker said: “Yes, indeed, and sporting too.
They say that hockey is bad for the figure, but I like a
fine open-air girl ... dear healthy things. Though of
course I admire the dainty type as well, <em>and</em> the clever
woman who wears glasses.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Johnson wound up this display of the
boundless broadness of mind existing among Turnham
Green matrons, by a magnificent declaration that <em>she</em>
believed a girl could be brainy without wearing glasses!
There is no knowing to what Rabelaisian extent the
conversation might have widened, had not Luke burst
in, with a gruff demand for tea; and dragging in his
wake the fifteen-year-old flapper from the boarding-house
next door:</p>

<p>&mdash;“Don’t look at me, Mrs. J. I’m sky blue with
cold; this horrid kid kept me standing hours and
hours listening to a stupid old man on a tub at a street-corner.
I declare, I wish I’d gone biking with Tommy
Cox; he asked me to come on his carrier.”</p>

<p>“Pity you didn’t, then,” growled Luke, eyes fixed
on Sebastian.</p>

<p>Jinny tossed back the curly brown hair which lapped
her shoulders; an enormous black bow stood out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
pertly from the nape of her neck. She wore a blue
woolly tam-o’-shanter, a string of green glass beads
round her bare throat, a striped flannel shirt, a green
serge skirt, very short to show her high brown boots,
and a brooch of her school badge and motto.</p>

<p>“I say, may I stop to tea?” she asked of Mrs.
Johnson, ignoring Luke.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Jinny; it won’t be ready till five o’clock,&mdash;but
some of us can wait in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker instantly apprehended Mrs. Johnson’s
sympathetic intentions towards Letty and Sebastian,
and with great alacrity went to the door.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jinny, dear; how’s your mother, this
sudden cold snap? ... ah, bless them ... sweet things
... young things ...” this last in a diminishing purr of
benediction.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s all right, thanks. Not much sense in going
in to tea till tea’s there, is it?&mdash;Oh, I see! All right!”
Jinny grinned at Letty, and followed in the wake of the
two ladies. “Come along, Luke.”</p>

<p>“In a minute.” Luke had planted himself on the
parlour sofa, with the obvious intention not to budge.</p>

<p>“<em>Now</em>, you boss-eyed mule. They want to be alone
together; they don’t want you.” Jinny conveyed to
him their probable intentions when quit of the crowd,
by an expressive pantomime of eating with <em>spoons</em>.</p>

<p>“Shut it! We’re not all such babies for jam.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say a word about jam,” exasperated by his
denseness. “And I’m jolly sure I shan’t come to tea
with you again.”</p>

<p>Luke growled something inarticulate; and Jinny,
head high in air, marched out and banged the door.
Luke’s coolness hurt her sometimes. She wore his ring
on the third finger of her left hand&mdash;a ring from an
expensive cracker,&mdash;and he escorted her to school every
morning, on the way to his own; not infrequently he
carried her satchel; when both their machines were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
repair, they biked; but this was not often. He was a
year older than she; a hobbledehoy youth of sixteen;
rather spotty about the face; and with a taste in ties,
that, starting in a bout of violent enthusiasm, had
suddenly stopped, before it emerged from the crude-colour
stages to something really tasteful. He was
surly in the company of ladies; and when his mother
spoke to him, always mumbled his replies; though it
was owing to her advanced views that on his sixteenth
birthday he was given a latchkey: “Show the boy
he’s free to come and go about the house as he likes,
Matthew, and he’ll never break out as he would if he
was too much kept in.” But as Mat Johnson could not
be prevailed upon at the same time to raise his son’s
pocket-money to more than sixpence a week, there
seemed indeed very small chance for Luke to break
out. Once or twice he had hung about at the end of his
street till the house was locked up at half-past ten, for
the pride of letting himself in at five-and-twenty to
eleven; but that was all. Dating from his sister’s
engagement, however, a subtle change had passed over
him; he was seen to read, instead of the cricket or
football papers he had been wont to patronize, a two-sheet
Socialist rag, named, with misleading mildness:
“Mine and Yours,”&mdash;and containing mostly threatening
references to “Yours.” Also, though he rarely spoke to
Sebastian, he evinced a dogged preference for that
young gentleman’s company; and very often, as now,
would sit in gloomy silence in the same room as the
twain; and refuse to move till Letty actually ordered
him forth. She hated doing this, as it looked as if she
“wanted Sebastian alone,” which in its turn rather
looked as if she “wanted Sebastian to kiss her.” Which
she did. But it was inconsiderate of Luke to force her
to the tacit admission.</p>

<p>“Can you make out why he’s so odd with Sebastian,
mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>“Letty, dear,” solemnly, “have I ever tried to force
my children’s confidence? Everything they tell me is
of their own free will,”&mdash;and indeed, it was extremely
little.</p>

<p>The tea-bell freed the couple in the parlour from the
infliction of Luke’s scrutiny. Jinny ignored her chum
throughout tea, by way of punishment for his defection.
And when the last rock-cake had been consumed,
declared she had to be going: “I’ve got piles of arith.,
and a four-page comp. for Monday, and Ma won’t let
me work Sundays because of the old tabby-cats in the
house and what they’ll say. Good-bye, Mrs. J. I’ve
had a scrumptious tea.”</p>

<p>Luke followed her into the hall.</p>

<p>“You’d better run along back to the parlour,” she
informed him crushingly.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You seem to find the Levi man better company
than me.”</p>

<p>“Jinny, I like you better than any other girl”; he
fumbled for her hand. Since months he had tried to
substitute ‘love’ for ‘like,’ but somehow Jinny made
it so hard for a fellow; she was always laughing or
snubbing him.</p>

<p>“Thanks; I’m honoured.”</p>

<p>Luke kicked the umbrella-stand. “One must be
polite&mdash;the Guvnor’s such a beast to him&mdash;and he’s
going to be my brother-in-law.... I don’t care a hang
about him, really.”</p>

<p>“Who would you like best for Letty’s sister-in-law?”
Jinny demanded, casually swinging her bulging satchel
of books.</p>

<p>“Who would <em>I</em> like for <em>Letty’s</em> sister-in-law?”</p>

<p>Jinny waited a bit. “Well&mdash;slowcoach?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what on earth you mean,” he said,
pondering the matter. And he hadn’t found her hand
yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bright boy!” she taunted him, and leaping the
three steps, tore up the three of the next house, and
vanished through the open front door.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, Luke said: “Oh!” It had
dawned upon him.</p>

<p>That evening, before retiring to bed, he banged at
Letty’s door, and, not waiting for permission, slouched
into her room. Quickly she covered up some mysterious
occupation at the writing-table.</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.” Luke stood by the mantelpiece, and
closely examined likenesses of Violet Baker, Michael
Mordkin, and Sebastian. Letty, really alarmed by his
uncanny behaviour, came up behind him, and slipped
an arm around his shoulders. “What is it, old boy?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Luke, have you been betting?”</p>

<p>“Not such a fool.”</p>

<p>She waited, head snuggled against his arm. Presently
he said, with great difficulty: “That fellow of yours,
<span class="lock">Letty&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Sebastian?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got more than one, have you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” indignantly she straightened herself.
And he blurted out:</p>

<p>“Look here&mdash;did he really&mdash;I mean, why was he such
an ass about his money?”</p>

<p>Letty re-seated herself at the writing-table, and
propping her short round little chin on her hands,
smiled pensively down at the blotting-paper, and made
no reply.</p>

<p>“Do you know what made him do it?” Luke persisted.</p>

<p>“How should I?”</p>

<p>But he seemed unable to leave the subject, now he
had embarked upon it. “You don’t seem to mind
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t mind one bit.”</p>

<p>“Pater’s mad about it. He’s always thinking of
money.” Luke, having to provide neither for the household
nor yet for himself, was duly contemptuous. “But
I’ve never <em>met</em> a fellow who chucked away a fortune&mdash;till
now,” he muttered, sitting astride of the writing-table.
His sister peered mischievously up into his
face:</p>

<p>“You like Sebastian, don’t you, Luke?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno about liking him,” hastily; “I think
he’s a bit off his chump, that’s all.” But as the rustics
gaped and marvelled at the lunacy of Don Quixote, so
hobbledehoy regarded with bewildered admiration his
future brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“&mdash;But as long as you’re not crying your eyes red
over it <span class="lock">all&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“What would you have done, if I had been, Luke?”
Letty enjoyed teasing her wretched young brother.</p>

<p>“Oh ... spoken to him, I suppose,” edging towards
the door. “’Night, Letty.”</p>

<p>“Luke, supposing he was&mdash;oh, just playing a game;
and one day came and said: ‘I’m as rich as I was
before!’”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t build on that if I were you. Chaps don’t
play those silly sort of games. Good night.”</p>

<p>And: “I know why, right enough,” reflected Luke,
in the passage; “but I wasn’t going to tell her. By
gum, though! fancy a fellow actually doing it....”</p>

<p>In Luke’s pocket, a column of “Mine and Yours,”
marked in red pencil, discoursed eloquently on the
Utopian conditions to be attained by mankind, when
those unfairly in possession of unearned increment,
should voluntarily fling their wealth into a common
pool, that it might be divided into equal shares for all.
The discourse wound up, with unconscious humour, by
the remark:&mdash;“But alas! only we who are willing to
share our sixpences have as yet seen the light; those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
with pounds weighing down their pockets, turn their
faces stubbornly away. And we labour on....”</p>

<p>Luke re-read all this, carefully; hallucination pointing
with her forefinger along the printed lines.&mdash;“By
gum!” he muttered again. And his eyes were those of a
disciple who has at length sighted the master....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smaller">“TO TEST HER LOVE”</span></h3>


<p>“Of course I know why,” reflected Letty; “but
I wasn’t going to tell him.”</p>

<p>But it was the need to express the joyous and
amazing romance of this which Sebastian had done, and
the rejection of each confidant in turn as “not able to
understand,” that had prompted Letty to cover so
many sheets of paper with her round schoolgirlish
handwriting, and to head these scrawlings with the title:
“To Test Her Love,” A Story. By Lettice Johnson.</p>

<p>The hero of her tale, one Geoffrey Challoner of
Challoner Park, becomes enamoured of Mavice, a
village maiden; and is goaded by the sneers of his
wicked cousin Jasper (&mdash;“You fool! she loves you
only because you are the Lord Geoffrey!”&mdash;) into
putting her love to the test by pretending to the discovery
of hidden papers whereby Jasper (of the younger
branch of the family) is proved master of Challoner
Park in his stead, and he a mere pauper. Affairs at this
juncture grow complicated; as Mavice, unshaken in
her love for Geoffrey, is yet forced to jilt him, without
giving a reason, in favour of Jasper, who most unfortunately
holds in his power the honour of Cyril, Mavice’s
younger brother, a weakling and a craven. With a
bitter: “You were right, Jasper; and I a fool to
think any girl, even the fairest, free from worldly
motives!” Geoffrey departs for the populous Bush,
leaving Jasper in unlawful possession of Challoner Park
and Mavice’s broken heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Letty was now engaged in a general clearing-up and
adjustment of the circumstances of her novelette.
Mavice and Geoffrey must be brought together; and
the heroine must have occasion to vow, with brimming
eyes: “Love you though you are poor, Geoffrey?&mdash;I
would love you if you came to me scorned by the whole
world,&mdash;old and ugly and in rags. Geoffrey, you
believe me, don’t you?” Then his great speech,
beginning: “Oh, my darling, how could I ever doubt
that your love would stand the test....” Letty
scribbled the subsequent scene, her cheeks aflame, her
fingers trembling so that it was a matter of difficulty to
guide the pencil. One day, yes, one day, Sebastian
would come to her, and say: “Oh, my darling, how
could I ever doubt...?”</p>

<p>She had never before experienced the fascination of
setting on paper, fragments of her own life, of glorifying
characters with whom she had actually come in contact.
To be sure, Luke had needed a little doctoring before
he was altogether fit to take his place as Cyril Derincourt;
but Sebastian accorded so perfectly with the
Lord Geoffrey, that Letty was able to derive more
voluptuous pleasure from the impassioned duets of her
fancy, than ever from those actually enacted. Sebastian
in the flesh was sometimes a little too fervent, too
realistic even, for timid girlhood; or else incomprehensibly
remote; but Geoffrey never by any chance
made a remark that Mavice could not entirely understand.
So Letty wrote with her heart, unhampered by
literary standards, literary judgment; knowing naught
of those over-intellectualized circles wherein Geoffrey
and Mavice, Jasper and Cyril, and the alluring adventuress
Esmée de Courcy (lately added), would meet
with laughter and contempt. Letty wrote on, her
evenings stabbed through and through by this secret
excitement,&mdash;till, reading over the completed story, it
struck her, with happy surprise, as not a whit less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
convincing or enthralling than all those other tales
which had fed her imagination since flapper days: the
“White Heather” Novelette Series; the “Silver
Chimes” Complete Novel, published every Tuesday;
the Myrtle Library; the Pink-and-Blue Boudoir
Supplement; fiction in coloured paper covers, stacked,
crumpled and torn, behind her bed-valance.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” brooded Letty, as she affixed a wobbling
signature to the manuscript, “if Sebastian would be
pleased to see me in print....”</p>

<p>To her, the be-all and end-all of literature was to
“get into print”; written stuff was of absolutely no
value otherwise. This secret of hers was swelling rather
too big to be borne alone; Violet Baker was, under
many vows, admitted to Letty’s confidence. Violet was
shorthand-typist to a firm of solicitors, and volunteered
to type, in her spare moments, “To Test Her Love,”
which she considered a veritable masterpiece.</p>

<p>“What made you think of it, I don’t know?”&mdash;And
on this point Letty continued to keep silence. Her sole
fear was that her achievement would mysteriously rob
her of feminine charm; place her in the same category
as those “clever girls,” “gifted women,” “the kind
men don’t like.” In which case, Letty decided, her talent
should at once, definitely, and for ever, be abandoned.</p>

<p>Finally, after much deliberation of choice, the type-script
was dispatched to the Editress of “Silver Chimes.”
After a little delay, came a letter offering five guineas
for full and complete rights in the fortunes of Geoffrey,
Mavice, Cyril, Esmée, and Jasper.</p>

<p>“That means they’re going to print it!” Letty flew
across the road to Violet Baker.</p>

<p>“Vi, they’re going to print it!”</p>

<p>Her tidings were not received with the acclamation
she expected. “Oh, everything’s all right for you,”
came muffled from the depths of a damp pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“Toothache?” queried Letty sympathetically.</p>

<p>“No, Ernie.”</p>

<p>“Not&mdash;not dead?”</p>

<p>... Presently Letty, her joy somewhat damped,
went tiptoeing back to Town House. It seemed
appropriate to tiptoe, for though Ernie was not dead,
Violet had sent him about his business. The frequent
comparison between his profile and Sebastian’s, his
manners and Sebastian’s, Sebastian’s ‘romantic air’&mdash;and
Ernie’s, had done their fell work. And now for
Letty to come rushing in with Fame in a typewritten
oblong envelope, and because of it expect Violet to go
capering round the dining-room,&mdash;well, it was rather
too much to ask even of Real Friendship.</p>

<p>“You jolly well get everything,” complained Violet
bitterly; “you’ve got the looks, and all the fuss made
over you, and a fellow who can say all the speeches, and
now you’ve got this too. And I was idiot enough to
type it for you, and give old Tomkyns the page about
where Jasper plots with Esmée de Courcy, instead of a
letter about somebody’s insurances, and he hopping
mad. You get everything.” Violet again immersed
herself in the handkerchief, and Letty departed, very,
very sorry, but rather resentful that having ‘everything’
she should therefore have to do without Violet.
“But I understand about Ernie,” she mused, sitting
down to reply to the Editress. If Sebastian had not
come along, would not she, Letty, with all her advantages
and prettiness, probably have drifted into a sort
of engagement with Balaam Atkins? very much of
the Ernie type, but older, and with slightly more jut to
his jaw. And then they would all have been cosy
together, and even Luke would probably not have
snubbed Jinny so frequently as he did now. The
advent of Sebastian had completely demoralized this
corner of Turnham Green.</p>

<p>With an effort, Letty managed to keep the secret of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
her letter from the family; she wanted Sebastian to be
the first to hear about it. Three days later, at tea-time,
she spied him walking dejectedly up the road. She was
alone in the dining-room; her mother was out, and
Luke not yet home from school.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! we can have tea together, just us two;
what a darling you are to come to-day,&mdash;and I’ve got
something too frightfully exciting to tell you ... your
hands are frozen; why don’t you wear gloves, you bad
boy?” joyfully she welcomed him, chafed his cold
fingers with her warm palms, hung about him like a
solicitous kitten. But still he didn’t speak. And, just
on the verge of pouring forth her great news, Letty
stopped, struck by the tragedy in his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” she cried piteously.</p>

<p>“They’ve rejected it.”</p>

<p>Then the pall descended upon her also. The Book.
They had rejected it. There was no more to be said.
And for the second time she was baffled of an elated
audience for her own triumph. How dared she presume
tell him of a tale accepted, when his great work had
been refused.</p>

<p>“The beasts!” she cried, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, Letty!” but whatever consolation
she had attempted would have been wrong. He was in
that mood. “Of course, they can’t take everything
that gets offered to them. My stuff’s not good enough,
that’s all. They&mdash;they wrote it wasn’t good enough,”
he finished, asking again for that sympathy which he
flung back when it came. He had been divided by the
pride which bade him keep his shame to himself, and a
childish longing for solace and encouragement and the
presence of someone who believed in him. Not sure yet
which need was the stronger, he announced his defeat
casually, as though it hardly affected him, hotly
resented Letty’s correct assumption that his world lay
shattered; and then, almost boasting the humiliation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
showed her a note from the publisher’s reader, who had
kindly taken the trouble to point out how and why his
work was not marketable, instead of merely enclosing
the formal slip: “&mdash;unable to make an offer.” “You
fail to convince,” was the phrase which left most sting.</p>

<p>“So you see I’m a failure, Letty. Not a publisher
will look at the book. This fellow knows what he’s
talking about.” Sebastian refused the muffins she
tendered him.</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;it will never get into print, you don’t
think?”</p>

<p>“Never. But it isn’t that; it’s&mdash;Heron.”</p>

<p>“Your friend?” She remembered the two had
been a great deal together, at the Farme.</p>

<p>He nodded, too full of bitterness to speak. Why was
it that all his burnt-offerings, like Cain’s, were doomed
to be beaten, sullen fumes, along the earth, instead of
mounting in steady columns of smoke, upwards to
their destination? That he might be worshipping false
gods, did not for a moment present itself as a possible
solution; Sebastian’s loyalty was convinced the
sacrifices were at fault, not the altar. The book was
Stuart’s book, for Stuart, of Stuart, to Stuart,&mdash;the
whole declension. The author had sweated his share,
and now the publishers withheld theirs, and all the
accomplished labour was in vain. It was <span class="lock">maddening&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I wanted it out!” Sebastian broke out, aloud.</p>

<p>“He wanted it in print, of course he did,” passionately
Letty shared his mutinous sorrow. And when he
had gone, and she was in her room, changing into an
evening blouse, she fingered the letter she had not had
the courage to show him; all her joy gone from the
anticipation of her story in print, since thus it would
only serve to point a contrast.</p>

<p>“I’ve half a mind not to send it,” picking up that
other letter into which was folded her eager acceptance
of the five-guinea offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish it was him instead of me,” wistfully. For
one does not lightly say ‘no’ to an Editress of “Silver
Chimes”; not if one is Letty Johnson.</p>

<p>She stood uncertain, an envelope in either hand....</p>

<p>“Supposing.... After all, it was his idea and not
mine, about pretending to be poor, and all that....
Almost, really, it’s as if I’d stolen it. Then supposing....”</p>

<p>Supposing what? That she should put his name,
instead of hers, to the novelette? That she should
surprise him by showing him a story by Sebastian Levi,
in print, as he so much wanted to be? Just to make up
for that other disappointment. Well, supposing you
did, Letty? Nobody need ever know that Sebastian
hadn’t written it, except Violet Baker; and she could
be pledged to silence.</p>

<p>“I will!” resolved Letty, her grey-blue eyes clouded
to seriousness beneath the tumbling fringe of her hair.
“I’ll go and see the Editress myself.”</p>

<p>This was rather a tremendous undertaking. But the
notion of being in a position to offer Sebastian the very
thing he deemed lost to his desire, so inflated Letty’s
courage, that she hardly faltered when the next day
seeking an interview with&mdash;“your <em>real</em> friend and
cousin, the Editress,” as the energetic little woman
signed “Cousin Belle’s Chat with Her Girls,” which
appeared every week on the last page of “Silver
Chimes.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“You want to publish your little tale with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i>?
Why, certainly. We have one lady who
always writes for us under the name: Joyella; and My
Girls like her touch immensely.”</p>

<p>Letty groped in vain after some association of ideas
between “Joyella” and a sale-of-underwear catalogue
that she had seen in her mother’s hand that morning.
Then gave up the search, and listened to what the
Editress was saying in praise of “To Test Her Love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to alter it in several places, of course;
you’ve had no experience, I can see that; but what we
liked about your characters, Miss Johnson, was that you
wrote as if you felt them. My girls always know the
difference. And that’s why, when a high-class authoress
comes along with her nose in the air and offers to
scribble me something in her spare time, I know it will
be no good. I tell her so, straight out. One can’t write
for My Girls with one’s nose in the air. They recognize
sincerity when they see it. You’ve got the sincere
touch, Miss Johnson; My Girls are sure to take to you.”
She brought forth her Girls as if they were a compact
little jury; she herself the judge; and Letty, or
Joyella, or the authoress writing with nose in air, the
prisoners on trial.</p>

<p>“Now, under what name do you want us to publish?”
Miss Symes drew her pencil through Lettice Johnson, and
looked up from the manuscript, with an encouraging
smile. Every line and angle and inflection proclaimed
her as orthodox Church of England. It was rather a
bad moment for Letty.</p>

<p>“Sebastian&mdash;&mdash;” she paused. Miss Symes wrote it
down. “Yes?” with pencil poised.</p>

<p>Almost, now, at the eleventh hour, Letty said
“Lovell,” and spoilt everything....</p>

<p>“Sebastian Levi,” in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Sebastian&mdash;&mdash;? I beg your pardon, I didn’t
catch it?”</p>

<p>Desperately, Letty repeated “Levi,” in tones that
nervousness had rendered far louder and more resonant
than she had intended them.</p>

<p>Still showing her teeth, though the brightness had
departed from her smile, the Editress added “Levi.”
Then put down the pencil.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, but does that strike you as a very
attractive pseudonym? Have you a special reason?”</p>

<p>“It was my mother’s name&mdash;before she married&mdash;&mdash;.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Letty felt the eyes of My Girls, that terrible army of
girls taking in “Silver Chimes” regularly every Tuesday,
fixed upon her in scornful disapproval. Their imaginary
stare quite obliterated all conscientious pangs concerning
Mrs. Johnson, who, despite broadmindedness, might
quite conceivably have resented being thus publicly
branded an Israelite.</p>

<p>Miss Symes made an ineffectual effort to convert
Letty to “Beryl Hope Feversham,” invented by
herself for the next “Silver Chimes” contributor in
search of a pleasant sounding <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i>. But Letty
clung to the thought of Sebastian’s ecstasy, seeing his
name above the published novelette, and remained
obdurate.</p>

<p>“To Test Her Love,” by Sebastian Levi, was to be
published three weeks hence; November the twenty-second
fixed as the important date.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, November the twenty-second, Letty
dashed down the road before breakfast, to the little
newspaper shop at the corner, and bought three copies
of the journal in the bright mauve cover, wreathed about
with silver bells swung in diverse directions by a
fantastic wind; in and out of the bells were threaded the
words: “To Test Her Love,” by Sebastian Levi; in
the centre of the page was inset a medallion, containing
presentments of Geoffrey with blazing eyes confronting
Mavice with bowed head, who was supported by a
malignant Jasper; Cyril skulking on the extreme left of
the picture, and Esmée de Courcy triumphant on the
extreme right. Beneath this pleasing illustration stood
the letter-press: “Mavice! speak! Are you indeed
engaged to him, or shall I strike him down as a liar?”
(see page 23).</p>

<p>Letty bore her treasures home, secreted in her muff;
Sebastian was to be the first to see; she had arranged
to meet him for a walk and tea that very afternoon.
But one copy of “Silver Chimes” she slipped into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
envelope, sought a name among the h’s in the telephone
book, addressed the envelope to: “Stuart Heron, Esq.,
Heron, Heron &amp; Carr, High Holborn,” and posted it
forthwith. She knew the beautiful friendship which
existed between the two men,&mdash;“like me and Violet,
before she turned so horrid&mdash;oh well, I s’pose she’s
miserable, and can’t help it, but still,”&mdash;knew also
that when Sebastian was shown the current issue of
“Silver Chimes” his first thought would be to exhibit
it to Stuart, just as his first disappointment when the
book was refused, was on Stuart’s account. Letty
wanted to be able to state she had forestalled him&mdash;“Mr.
Heron is perhaps reading it now, this very minute,&mdash;and
oh, Sebastian! what do you think he’ll say?”</p>

<p>Her day passed in a dreamy mauve-hued blur, with
a clangour of bells in the air. At four o’clock Letty
donned her new winter costume of royal-blue velveteen,
her golden fox-furs, and a blue plush picture-hat; and
again with something tightly clasped inside her muff,
almost danced out of the house into the drizzling gloam
beyond. Sebastian was waiting for her where the
No. 9 ’buses stop on their way to Richmond. His plan
was to walk across the Park, and have a late tea at
some window overlooking the pale mist-sodden river.
Letty would have preferred a cosier programme; she
assented, reluctantly, to the top of the ’bus, “if you
promise to keep the umbrella held over my hat,
Sebastian,”&mdash;but cancelled the walk across Richmond
Park: “Horrid, in the dark, with the leaves all messy
and slippery, and the trees like <span class="lock">ghosts&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>&mdash;“And the world smelling damp, and reeking damp,
and dripping damp, and we the only people warm in it!
Why, Letty, you’d enjoy it!”</p>

<p>“But we shouldn’t be warm.”</p>

<p>“We would, if I held you close enough; Letty....”</p>

<p>“But my shoes!” she showed him her footgear, to
prove the impossibility of his proposals. All this under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
pallid stream of light from the lamp-post, at the corner
where they lingered for their ’bus.</p>

<p>“Will I never teach you not to wear pneumonia-soles,
you little vanity-child?” sighed Sebastian. But the
lifted folds of the skirt had afforded a pleasant glimpse,
nevertheless; and he wished he could afford the
privacy of a taxi, that he might caress her rounded
slenderness at will. It was noble, but inconvenient, to
be forever short of cash. However, they were the only
passengers on the outside of their lurching chariot;
and afterwards the only two in the snug brightly lit
tea-room which formed one of a labyrinthine cluster
underground, each holding four rose-tiled tables, and a
rose-gowned waitress. The latter took Sebastian’s
order, and vanished.</p>

<p>“Now...” thought Letty&mdash;and produced “Silver
Chimes.” Without a word of comment, so fraught was
the moment with tense expectation, she pushed the
copy across the table. Sebastian picked it up, wondering,
and read aloud: “‘To Test Her Love,’ by <em>Sebastian
Levi</em>...? Why, w-w-what on earth&mdash;&mdash;?” he stammered.
His eye fell on the illustration; then in silent
bewilderment he flicked over a few of the pages. Letty
watched him, her fingers curled tightly round the edge
of the table. The lines of his mouth hardened. He
spoke harshly:</p>

<p>“Is it a joke? Who put my name to this drivel?”</p>

<p>And the dancing joy in her eyes was quenched in a
rush of tears. As before from anticipation, so now from
disappointment, she remained mute.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Letty? Who put my name to this?”</p>

<p>“I did,” almost inaudibly.... But why was he so
cross? Was it that his integrity recoiled from the
notion of claiming credit for work not his own? Yes,
it must be that. For the moment, she had forgotten his
use of the term: drivel.</p>

<p>“But it <em>is</em> yours, really and truly, Sebastian. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
idea is yours, all about the Test, and pretending not to
be rich, and everything. I’d never have thought of it.
I only did the writing part because&mdash;because you were
so busy with your book. But it’s quite, quite fair that
your name should be on the cover.”</p>

<p>“You wrote this?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” A tinge of pride in her assent. Had not the
Editress said the tale was good? “Yes, indeed I did.
Are you surprised?”</p>

<p>(Or was he already beginning to think her unwomanly?)</p>

<p>The waitress appeared with the tea-things, which she
rattled down on the table. Sebastian buried himself
anew in the histories of Geoffrey and Mavice, while
Letty poured out the tea, and nibbled at a cress sandwich;
furtively gleaming at him from under her
eyelashes.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hungry, Sebastian?”</p>

<p>He made no reply; went on reading. He had as a
boy devoured a great many “penny dreadfuls” of the
blood-and-thunder type; but this was his first experience
of girls’ cheap sentimental fiction. It was a
revelation. Now he understood one or two curious
ingredients which had hitherto always puzzled him in
the composition of Letty.&mdash;But what did she mean by
saying that his was the original idea of Lord Geoffrey
Challoner’s utterly inane proceedings? Then, slowly,
that dawned on him as well. He shoved aside “Silver
Chimes,” so that it fell on the dusty floor.</p>

<p>“Letty, did you think it was by way of a test, a test
of you, that I gave up my income?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“My God, no!”</p>

<p>“Then <span class="lock">why&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“You wouldn’t understand why,” grimly; “it won’t
translate into novelette terms.”</p>

<p>Letty stretched out her hand for a cream-cake, pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and chocolate. It fell from her shaking fingers on to her
skirt. She gazed hopelessly at the stain. It was all of a
piece with this hateful afternoon, to spoil every one of
her illusions, and her new costume into the bargain.</p>

<p>“I expect my hat’s all spotted by the rain, too,” she
reflected dreamily. And he had called her story
“drivel.”... With a quick spurt of anger at his
lofty denunciation, Letty cried:</p>

<p>“The Editress said I had the sincere touch, so there!”</p>

<p>He saw how he had hurt her, and was sorry; but felt
at the same time the futility of attempting to explain
the cause of his annoyance.</p>

<p>“Oh, well&mdash;eat up your cakes, dear; I don’t suppose
anyone who matters will ever buy this particular rag.
Lord, though,” half under his breath, “if Stuart had
seen it!”</p>

<p>“I sent him a copy this morning,” Letty threw out
defiantly. She was in the naughty mood of a child, who,
seeking to please most, has somehow only earned a
scolding, and is in consequence rightly sore and resentful.</p>

<p>... In the ghastly silence which followed her
announcement, another party entered the room, and
noisily disposed themselves at the adjoining table. The
waitress entered to take their order, and Sebastian
beckoned her to bring him his bill. The homeward
journey was accomplished by train, in a moist overfull
compartment, where Sebastian had to give up his seat
to a lady, and Letty sat huddled in a corner, frightened
at the dire effect of her action, and repeating to herself
again and again: “I don’t care; he’s hateful; I don’t
care a bit.”</p>

<p>Still without a word, beyond a brief “good night,”
he left her at the gate of Town House, and set out for
Carlton House Terrace. He had little doubt as to what
sort of a ribald reception awaited him there. Not much
mercy to be expected from Stuart. All Sebastian’s most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
sensitive portions were already screaming and wincing
in protest. He had so desired to present Stuart with a
dignified bound volume, setting forth in fervent but
lucid phrasing, an abstract ideal,&mdash;and now, instead, this
unspeakable novelette! The incident was grotesque;
it had degraded to farce all his high aspirations. It was
no good shirking his visit; the matter had to be
explained. Sebastian walked ever faster, in mingled
exasperation and dread. Arrived at his destination, he
was shown into the drawing-room, where Mrs. Heron,
Stuart, Mr. Arthur Heron, and a pretty flapper in white,
whom he had met once before at the house, were
assembled, before dinner. Stuart was lounging in front
of the fire-place, and evidently engaged in chaffing the
child, when Sebastian was announced.</p>

<p>&mdash;“You see, Babs, by your passionate public assertions
that I was your idea of a perfect gentleman, you
very definitely proved yourself no lady. One isn’t
passionate, in society. I really don’t know, after this,
what we can do with you! what do you think, mother?...
Hullo, Levi!” he bestowed on the new-comer a
slow fiendish smile that confirmed Sebastian’s worst
anticipations. Babs at once enlisted his sympathies in
her cause:</p>

<p>“Mr. Levi, I heard someone, at a party, saying a
horrid thing about Stuart; and of course I stuck up
for him. And now he says I’ve committed a breach of
etiquette, and the Queen, when she gets to hear of it,
will strike my name from the presentation lists, the year
after next. <em>Do</em> say it isn’t true!”</p>

<p>“My dear, you really ought to be accustomed by now
to your cousin’s teasing.&mdash;You’ll dine with us, of course,
Mr. Levi?” Mrs. Heron extended a thin ringed hand,
smiling graciously. She looked very handsome, in her
low-necked black gown, and her single row of wonderful
pearls.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s impossible.” Sebastian longed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
these invitations, but invariably, by some perverse
twitch of the nerves, refused them when they came.
He and Stuart went into the latter’s study. Conspicuous
on the table lay a booklet bound in a mauve paper
cover, wreathed about with silver bells.</p>

<p>“I haven’t quite finished your story yet,” said
Stuart, caressing it lovingly; “it has made me a very
happy man, Levi!”</p>

<p>“And me a deuced miserable one,” growled Sebastian,
flinging himself into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>“That, my lad, is because you have caused Esmée de
Courcy to appear at noon, in Regent Street, wearing a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décolletée</i> toilet of yellow sequins. Such riotous
rollicking literary excesses are bound to result in your
present reaction of soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” miserably. Stuart was sitting on
the table, the novelette on his knees. Leaning forward,
Sebastian snatched it away, and flung it into the fire.</p>

<p>“There are thousands more on the market,” chortled
Stuart; “I intend to forward a copy to Magdalen; for
an original exploit of one of Oxford’s sons, I think it
deserves to stand in the College chronicles.”</p>

<p>Sebastian writhed. “Don’t be indecent, Heron,” in
a feeble appeal to the other’s better nature. An appeal
totally unfruitful of results.</p>

<p>“Surely, Levi, you didn’t send me your masterpiece
in the erroneous supposition that I would take it up
tenderly and treat it with care?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t send it to you at all.”</p>

<p>“No, I guessed you hadn’t sufficient guts for that!
Whom have I to thank, then, for my moments of rich
ripe pleasure?”</p>

<p>“Letty.”</p>

<p>“God bless Letty. Did she write it, by the way?”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you <em>didn’t</em> think I wrote it, did you? Heron,
you didn’t?” Sebastian’s dark mournful eyes implored
satisfaction on this one point, at least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, it’s not at all unlike your
style.”</p>

<p>“What the Hell do you mean by that?” Sebastian
sprang to his feet, knocking his shins against the brass
coal-box. “My <span class="lock">book&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>&mdash;“Is no book, any more than Letty’s maiden effort
is a book. They’re both&mdash;what shall I call ’em?&mdash;Gory
Exhibitions!” And having his victim completely
down and at his mercy, Stuart proceeded forthwith to
pummel him; showing thereby&mdash;despite Babs’ defence&mdash;a
most lamentable lack of all gentlemanly instincts.
But he had not forgiven his disciple for butchering his
ideas; nor for sickening him with his own creed, as had
been the case ever since Sebastian’s over-enthusiastic
conversion.</p>

<p>&mdash;“You both write in blood, instead of in ink; upon
my word, your style is like a pirate’s oath. No attempt
at restraint or form. Form’s everything&mdash;colour
nothing. One should write from the vantage-point of a
god,&mdash;at least of a judge; aloof, impersonal, detached.
But you take a bath every time, in what you’re pleased
to call your inspiration: wallow, and splash, and
breathe heavily, and yelp in your ecstasies, and wriggle
in your agonies, all over the pages. I even suspect you
of putting things down for the ‘sheer joy’ of unburdening
yourself. And there we have the greatest evil. A
book should be thought, crystallized into truth, hard as
rock, stripped of all extraneous fungus, and with some
clear purpose to serve in publication, whether of good or
evil. But if you must have your attacks of luxurious
hysteria,&mdash;for Heaven’s sake, man, keep ’em private.
Suppress them. Suppress the ‘Sprawls of Sebastian’&mdash;‘Sebastian
Spills Himself,’ as the stuff shouts to be
called.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry any further,” Sebastian said,
with very stiff lips, and a weary battered bewilderment
as to what he had done, that ever since a certain night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of August he should be exposed to these onslaughts;
“because the book’s been refused.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!”</p>

<p>“And it was for you&mdash;not at all for the ‘sheer joy of
unburdening,’&mdash;just for you....” But Sebastian
kept these reflections to himself. And Stuart continued
consolingly:</p>

<p>“But Letty’s story is no better than yours, for all
that; it’s equally highly coloured and shapeless, but
in a more marketable key.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Dear old man, don’t gaze at me as if I had you on
the rack. I’m trying to help you. I suppose you’ve
behaved like a brute to the little girl, over this business?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to break with her, that’s all!” suddenly
Sebastian recovered from the temporary paralysis of
speech, and, striding about the room, vehemently
poured forth his determination: “Yes, I am. We’re
not made for each other. She doesn’t understand&mdash;anything.
And I get hopeless over stupidity; it numbs
me. She shouldn’t have done this thing and even
now she can’t see why. She doesn’t see why I gave up
living at home&mdash;nor why the book meant so much to me.
It won’t do&mdash;it would never do&mdash;it must end now,
now!... I’m like you, Heron, I must be free of everything,
especially of love, the warm, clinging, hampering
fingers of love; I’m growing more and more like
<span class="lock">you&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense; you can’t possibly grow like me,
because I’m not there; not permanently. You can
grow like your father, or the Albert Memorial, anything
fixed and solid,&mdash;but you can’t grow like the spot
where I stood a minute ago before I began to run.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to break with Letty,” Sebastian repeated
doggedly.</p>

<p>“And you think you’re doing a fine thing by it?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Stuart twisted round on the table, and scornfully eyed
his young prototype. “It’s rather easy, isn’t it, to
break off with love because just at this moment you
happen to be fed up with it. There’s no merit in that,&mdash;merely
self-indulgence again. But try breaking-off with
love when you want it most, when it’s fairest, most
devilishly alive. Try breaking off, not because you’re
annoyed with the girl, childishly pettishly annoyed,&mdash;but
for the sake of keeping love unsated, and the
memory of love like a sword-blade. Break off with love,
because self-denial maintaineth the soul lean, and
whetteth desire, and&mdash;oh, because if you can do that,
and also guard your tongue from overmuch cursing
when directly afterwards a smug couple dog your
footsteps wherever you walk, and perform for your
benefit,&mdash;then there’s very little else can affect you,
ever. You’re master, then. At the height is the time
to break with any credit, my lad, not half-way down
the slope.”</p>

<p>Sebastian broke in: “But that’s cruel&mdash;inhuman&mdash;as
a god might behave. No man alive would do it.” His
heart was beating thickly; he could not tell why.</p>

<p>“Think not?” Stuart rose, stood against the
chimney-piece, dropping the ash of his cigarette into the
fire. And he said slowly: “I never told you about
Peter, did I?”...</p>



<p class="tbpara">Sebastian stormed out of the room, down the stairs,
into the hall. The dinner-gong was drowning the house
in sound. The postman had just thundered at the door.
Sebastian wanted to get away&mdash;away from this new
brutality of idea which terrified him because he knew it
would ultimately overtake him. It was revolting ...
revolting, he repeated, smashing behind him the iron
gates of the drive,&mdash;this deliberate murder of love to
which Stuart had just confessed. Revolting in the
same way as would have been the sight of a monk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
engaged in self-laceration. There was nothing splendid
about it,&mdash;no, nothing at all! between clenched teeth
Sebastian thus informed the wet glittering pavements.</p>

<p>And he was going back to Letty, straight back, driven
by the fear of what he might have been induced to do to
her ... if he were not quite determined to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Back to Letty. The Johnsons’ maid, opening the
door to him, said: “Miss Letty’s just going to bed,
sir, she’s not very well.”&mdash;And there she was, on the
stairs, dragging her feet a little, as if tired out.</p>

<p>“Letty!”</p>

<p>She came down to him then, and laid her arms against
his breast; and he bowed his head on to the soft
warm skin of them, murmuring that he was sorry&mdash;so
<span class="lock">sorry&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I hoped you’d be pleased, Sebastian. I thought you
wanted to get into print. I did so hope you’d be
pleased.”</p>

<p>“I’m a beast, Letty.&mdash;No, don’t move, darling&mdash;not
for a minute&mdash;let me go on telling you&mdash;I’m a surly
ungrateful brute ... but I love <span class="lock">you&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>She raised her lips for his kiss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stuart, following Sebastian’s headlong rush from the
room, reached the hall just as the heavy oak doors
crashed behind his impetuous young devot. Shrugging
his shoulders, the master of the house turned to enter
the dining-room; the butler waylaid him, offering a
letter on a silver tray:</p>

<p>“The post has just come in, sir.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Stuart that once before he had stood, as
he stood now, with the echoes of the dinner-gong still
vibrating through the hall, and in his hand an envelope,
addressed in just this same thin pointed writing....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
He drew forth the white and silver of a wedding invitation:</p>

<p>“Madame Marcel des Essarts requests the pleasure of
Mr. Stuart Heron’s company at the marriage of her
granddaughter Merle with Jean Raoul Théodore, Comte
de Cler, at St. George’s, Hanover Square, and afterwards
at 63 Lancaster Gate.”</p>

<p>&mdash;So Merle was to be married. He had almost forgotten
Merle; that exquisite little lady whom for a
while he and Peter had taught to become a child and a
pirate and a romp; whom they had crinkled out of
serene composure into delicious laughter; whom they
had dragged from an atmosphere of hothouse vigilance
into the keen airs and fleet sweet liberty. Stuart
speculated as to whether, after this lapse of time, aught
remained in Merle of his influence. One spot rubbed
forever bare of the polish, perhaps; one nerve that
would always be restless; one memory that could just
occasionally sting her from content. He would go to
Merle’s wedding, if only to see what sort of a fellow was
this Jean Raoul Théodore, Comte de Cler.&mdash;“Sure to be
a stumor ...” it was a queer thing, but Stuart suspected
most men to be stumors, who gathered up his
litter of orange-peel.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I did her any good?”...</p>

<p>Mrs. Heron came out of the drawing-room, her hand
on Arthur Heron’s arm; Babs following.</p>

<p>“Just think, Stuart: Merle des Essarts is going to
be married.” They passed into the dining-room. “I’ve
just had the invitation. I believe that Madame des
Essarts and I are not on particularly good terms; she
neither came to my last big At Home, nor answered
the card, nor called afterwards. However.... This
Comte de Cler is a most distinguished man. A diplomat.
I know him slightly. Much older than the girl, of
course; but such charming manners. Isn’t it suitable?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>She asked the question rather anxiously, not quite
sure if the son of the house of Heron had not once himself
deigned to cast an eye towards la maison des Essarts.</p>

<p>“Merle would be a delightful acquisition in the
highest ambassadorial circles,” Stuart assented warmly.</p>

<p>But he still suspected Jean de Cler of being a stumor.</p>

<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="smaller">JOHNSONESE</span></h3>


<p>Luke was with Jinny at the cake-shop.</p>

<p>“Have another?” said Jinny.</p>

<p>He hesitated. It was her birthday, and she
had been tipped, and was treating him. This would
have seemed a natural proceeding a year ago, when he
would have crammed himself to the utmost limits
of her capital. But Luke was growing up; and
though not sufficient of a man to forbid the lady to pay,
was yet not sufficient of a boy unquestioningly to accept
the fifth cream bun. Therefore he compromised with
himself: he would ask her to state exactly her financial
position; if it exceeded half a crown, he would eat that
bun, and be damned to delicate considerations and social
etiquette. But if <span class="lock">less&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“How much cash have you got, Jinny?”</p>

<p>“Four and six,” promptly; “half a crown from Uncle
Will, and two bob from old Simmons. But of course
you’ve already eaten some of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, and so’ve you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only had three, three twopennies&mdash;that’s sixpence;
you’ve had four.”</p>

<p>“The shortcake’s a penny.”</p>

<p>“Sevenpence, then. And a lemonade each. And
two&mdash;three sticks of chocolate cream;” Jinny did
rapid mental calculations&mdash;she was top of her form in
arithmetic&mdash;and announced two and elevenpence as
still remaining from her four and six, after expenses
were deducted. Whereat Luke, much relieved, took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
fifth cake, satisfied that he had solved the difficulty in
fashion befitting a man of the world.</p>

<p>“We’re going to invite you to our Christmas dinner,”
he remarked, his mouth full.</p>

<p>“How topping! Who else?”</p>

<p>“The old Baker woman, and Vi. Balaam Atkins,&mdash;he’s
mashed on Letty, you know. Granpa and Aunt
Lou&mdash;Granpa’s good for a present, anyway. Oh, and
your precious Tommy Cox!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! He’s spiffing fun. Ever heard him imitate
turkeys gobbling?”</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t want to. And I don’t suppose he’d
find it difficult. He’s to be lugged in for Vi Baker; she’s
supposed to have a broken heart, or some such tommy-<span class="lock">rot&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“And your mother thinks that <em>Tommy’s rot</em> will cheer
her up?” Jinny exploded into giggles at her own wit;
“I say, Luke, did you hear? I <span class="lock">said&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, keep your hair on! I don’t want to hear it
again.”</p>

<p>“Sour grapes! you wouldn’t have thought of it
yourself. But won’t Letty’s fellow be there?”</p>

<p>“Sebastian? Oh, rather; didn’t I count him? I
say,” Luke leant forward confidentially across the rickety
green tin table, “you know how snarky Pater was about
him? Well, two mornings ago he had a letter from old
Levi&mdash;I heard him tell Mater about it&mdash;and ever since,
he’s simply oiled himself all over Sebastian. And I
believe he’s come to see him this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Who’s come to see who, stupid?”</p>

<p>“Old Levi. He’s frightfully rich. Come to see
Pater.”</p>

<p>“Then why isn’t Sebastian frightfully rich? Has
he quarrelled with his dad?”</p>

<p>“Secret,” said Luke shortly. “Come along, let’s be
off.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;wait&mdash;tell me, Luke. Do. I won’t tell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
honest Injun. You might, Luke, because it’s my birthday.”</p>

<p>“As if that was a reason,” scorning her femininity.
“Besides, you’ll blab.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t.” And she added: “You might tell
me, Luke,&mdash;I’m paying for your tea.”</p>

<p>Luke was not offended; indeed, he thought she had
put forth a fairly strong argument.</p>

<p>“Well, when he got sort of engaged to Letty, his
Guv’nor was going to make him partner at the Stores,
and start him on fifteen hundred quid a year.” He
repeated the sum impressively. And Jinny gasped:</p>

<p>“My hat!”</p>

<p>“He’s chucked it,” finished Luke, still more impressively.</p>

<p>“My <em>hat</em>! Whatever for?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s a Socialist.”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make?”</p>

<p>Luke embarked on an explanation of the first principles
underlying the code of equality; threw in a few
cutting sentences regarding the palpable unfairness of
“one law for the rich and another for the poor”; and
wound up by reading his companion a column from the
current issue of “Mine and Yours.”</p>

<p>“But that’s all balmy bosh,” was Jinny’s comment.</p>

<p>“<em>Is</em> it?” huffily. “As it happens, I’m a Socialist
myself.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> are? Crumbs! Why?”</p>

<p>Luke fumbled in vain for words with which to express
the queer gleam which had penetrated the murkiness
of his schoolboy soul; soul hitherto stamped solely
with football scores, surliness, and Jinny; with cheap
cigarettes and brandyballs; canings, ink, and the
“usual beastliness” of everything. Thereunto had
lately to be added the astounding novelty of someone
who sacrificed material advantages for the sake of an
abstract idea; and the blended beauty and absurdity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of the proceeding had uplifted Luke to a queer sense of
gladness that such a miracle should actually take place
within his ken; had even inspired him with an inarticulate
desire to imitate ... somehow. His shyness had
never permitted him to confide in Sebastian; otherwise
he might have received another shock on hearing that
in this case Socialism was not the motive of renunciation.
Sebastian, for his part, might have found some
difficulty in translating into Johnsonese the twisted
asceticism of Stuart Heron.</p>

<p>But Luke only dogged in boorish silence his sister’s
betrothed. And Sebastian thought his future brother-in-law
rather an uncouth lad, with whom he could never
have anything in common.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Luke realized the impossibility of
laying before Jinny the wonder of a share-and-share-alike
community, while she was very importantly calling
for the bill, and clinking her coins on to the table;
especially as he had absently overstepped his self-imposed
limit, and eaten twopence off the half-crown.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jinny, catching up her hockey-stick,
and marching out of the shop. She had played in
a match that afternoon, and won it, three goals to one.
And, re-living her victory, she had forgotten all about
Luke’s recent outburst. He followed her into the High
Street, and thence round the corner into the quiet road
running at right angles, and ending abruptly in a high
wall which shut off the railway embankment. Luke
slouched past the gate of Town House.</p>

<p>“Hi!” shouted Jinny, who had halted at the boarding
establishment next door; “have you eaten so much
as to forget your own address, fathead?”</p>

<p>“No ... walk with me as far as the wall, Jinny?”</p>

<p>“Why ever?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno; needn’t if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>She yielded. The constant vituperations with which
she adorned her speech, were merely used in defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
as the porcupine shoots its quills. She laboured under
a fifteen-year-old delusion that rudeness is the equivalent
of wit. But she was very fond of Luke. In fact, in
spite of her many assertions to the contrary, her inmost
heart preferred him to the redoubtable Tommy Cox.</p>

<p>“Well, what now?” she demanded, in softer tones
than usual, as they leant up against the wall.</p>

<p>He looked at her; her curls were tumbled about her
neck; her face was a warm blur through the humid
mists of a late afternoon in December. Sebastian had
been especially devoted to Letty during the last fortnight,
and the prevailing atmosphere of sentiment and
tenderness had infected Luke. He felt now that he
wanted something more of his girl than repartee....
Suddenly he plunged forward; his lips missed her
mouth, but landed somewhere in the dim hollow of her
throat.</p>

<p>... “Jinny!”</p>

<p>A train thundered along the bank overhead, shook the
wall, passed in a rush of light, leaving in its wake a
long-drawn-out plaintive whistle....</p>

<p>Then Jinny pulled herself away: “Oh, crumbs!
don’t be sloppy!” she cried, and ran swiftly down the
road, clattering her hockey-stick along the pavement.</p>

<p>Luke, for very shame, remained rooted to the spot
long after he had heard the door of number twenty-seven
bang behind her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Johnson saw his guest off at the front door.
Then, with the air of a man completely satisfied, went
into the parlour to report to his wife.</p>

<p>“Did you ask him if he wanted tea, Matthew?”</p>

<p>Her husband smiled broadly. “He had a drink and
a cigar, my dear.”</p>

<p>“One of your good cigars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Johnson nodded; and she knew therefore that
all was well, and that she might safely ask questions.
“What did he say about Sebastian? Did he tell you
the reason&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“That he did.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Ned Levi told me in confidence, Frances.”</p>

<p>“Well?” brushing aside this trifling objection.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to prevent a public engagement as
soon as ever you like,” said Mr. Johnson with dignity;
“and nothing to prevent ’em getting married as soon
as <em>they</em> like. <em>I</em> don’t know what we’ve been waiting
for.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been waiting for your consent, Mat,” gently.</p>

<p>“They have it; oh, they have it.” Mr. Johnson’s
voice blessed the absent pair.</p>

<p>“And what does Sebastian’s father say about
Sebastian not taking his money?” asked Mrs. Johnson,
returning to the charge.</p>

<p>And having let five minutes elapse since his promise
of secrecy, Mr. Johnson felt he might now with honour
let the cat out of the bag:</p>

<p>“The cub got it into his head, at Oxford or some such
place, that he wouldn’t take money that had been made
in trade. It may be that some other young snob told
him that the Stores swindled pence out of people’s
pockets. Comes of sending your son to Oxford. And
you wanted Luke to go there.”</p>

<p>“I believe it’s a good place in its way, Mat,” Mrs.
Johnson said, tolerating Oxford.</p>

<p>“Ned Levi thinks the boy can’t fail to come round
all right when he’s married to a sensible girl. That’s
why he’s anxious to hurry on the wedding.”</p>

<p>“But meanwhile they can’t live on nothing, Mat.
They can’t live on Sebastian’s hundred a year.”</p>

<p>“I’m allowing ’em four hundred a year, just to keep
’em going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>“But&mdash;Matthew&mdash;&mdash;” Mrs. Johnson was completely
astounded at her husband’s sudden magnificent
disposal of half his income.</p>

<p>He winked at her; a slow and prodigious wink:
“Ned Levi’s money, my dear; every cent of it. But
not a word to Sebastian.”</p>

<p>Thus the plot stood revealed.</p>

<p>“I’m a great one for argerment,” continued Mr.
Johnson; “and I said to him: ‘Levi’ I said, him and
me being old pals, ‘Levi’ I said, ‘trade’s as good as any
profession if we in trade like to consider any profession
as good as us; and that’s logic. But since your
jackanapes seems set against takin’ trade-money,
what’s to prevent him refusing mine?’ Eh? That’s
what I said.”</p>

<p>“And what is, Mat?”</p>

<p>“What is what?”</p>

<p>“To prevent him refusing yours?”</p>

<p>“It won’t be mine. It’ll be Ned Levi’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s to prevent Sebastian refusing it,
whoever of you it comes from?”</p>

<p>But Mr. Johnson seemed to think Sebastian was
already “coming round.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed him different since a couple of weeks.
More easy-like and anxious to please. Only he’s too
proud to go galloping straight back to the Stores and
say: ‘Please, sir, I was an ass, give me my partnership
and fifteen hundred per annum.’ He’ll say it by
degrees. And half of the whole boiling is his when Ned
dies. Not but that Ned’s as young as I am, but he looks
tired and worn, poor fellow; sort of wistful round the
eyes when he said: ‘Johnson, it isn’t your dowry to
your daughter he’ll object to; it’s only my help he won’t
take; so it must reach him through a back door.’ But
Sebastian Levi’s a good match for our girl, Frances,
even if he’s gone temporary mad; now that I know his
father’s not set against him, as I was afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson began: “I was wondering&mdash;&mdash;” and
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>He encouraged her: “Speak up, old lady.”</p>

<p>“Whether we mightn’t announce the wedding
officially at our Christmas dinner. Half the people don’t
even know Letty’s engaged.”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I was <span class="lock">wondering&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“You’ll hurt yourself with wondering so much,”
remarked Mr. Johnson facetiously.</p>

<p>“About inviting Mr. Levi. You see, he’s a Jew.”</p>

<p>“What of it? <em>I</em> don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I. But <em>does</em> one, to a Christmas dinner?”</p>

<p>“Why not?... Oh! Ah!...” slowly in Mr.
Johnson’s brain, an atmosphere of holly, plum-pudding,
gifts, and jocularity, cleared away, to reveal for an
instant the event for which the festival stood as symbol.</p>

<p>“Ah. Um.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson folded up her work. “I’m going over
to consult Millicent Baker; she knows more about Jews
than we. I shouldn’t like to do the wrong thing about
it, and hurt his feelings.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker, when the problem was formally laid before
her, delivered judgment against. “He might not be
able to eat the food. If it isn’t cooked Kosher. Of
course, if you want to put yourself <span class="lock">out&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I couldn’t possibly ask that much of Cook. When
we’re twelve sitting down as it is. And I don’t think
my father would care about a&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;Kosher
plum-pudding. It doesn’t sound convivial,
does it?” doubtfully.</p>

<p>“And yet, Sebastian’s father has a right to be
present, hasn’t he? Even if it makes extra trouble.”
Mrs. Baker hovered uncertainly; the rich Ned Levi,
she knew, was a widower; Mr. Baker had been in his
grave since fourteen years.</p>

<p>“What I’m most afraid of,” Mrs. Johnson confessed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
“is that he’ll feel bound to ask us back to one of <em>his</em>
religious festivals,&mdash;that funny one where the Jews go
up on the roof and eat pineapple.”</p>

<p>“Dear things,” murmured Mrs. Baker.</p>

<p>“I approve highly of all these picturesque customs,”
explained the other lady, painstakingly. “But not for
myself. Pineapple in large quantities disagrees with me.
Especially the tinned kind. And I believe they have to
sit cross-legged.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Baker, who on questions of etiquette was
really invaluable, suggested the brilliant compromise
that Mr. Levi, senior, should be invited to dine at Town
House on Boxing Day.&mdash;“Or on the day after Boxing
Day, to make it quite safe.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be Christmas, really Christmas, at all
any more, would it?” Considerably easier in her mind,
now that the vexed question was settled, Mrs. Johnson
returned home again; having first arranged that on the
occasion of Mr. Levi’s visit, Mrs. Baker should “just
drop in,” and aid in his entertainment, on the strength
of her experience at Laura Silberstein’s wedding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letty stopped in front of a giant notice-board, which
signified: “To Be Let Or Sold.”</p>

<p>“Want to shee inside dat house,” she announced,
in coaxing baby language. “Oo, please, Sebastian,
want to shee inside.” She tugged imperiously at his
hand.</p>

<p>Behind the murky strip of garden, black windows
glimmered faintly in a spectral building.</p>

<p>“Darling baby,” Sebastian replied, responding to her
whim, “don’t you know that a big bogey-man lives
behind that door, and you’ll hear his bones rattle
through the letter-box?”</p>

<p>But Letty only tugged the harder, up the damp
gravel path. “One can never tell,” stopping and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
facing him, her blue eyes very serious, her soft curls
clinging to cheek and forehead, in little wet tendrils,
“how soon we may want a house, now that father has
grown nice to you.”</p>

<p>She might equally well have said: “Now that you’ve
grown nice to me.” For never had she and Sebastian
been so happy together, not even in their first days of
courtship, as since their quarrel and reconciliation a
fortnight ago. He no longer oppressed her with his
moody fits, nor snubbed her when she strove to intrude
on his remoteness; he even let her minister to one of
his headaches, to her great content; moreover, he
seemed possessed by a real lover’s craving for her
constant companionship; and the note in his voice
when he spoke her name, filled her with a tremulous
wish to cry and laugh, both at the same time.</p>

<p>&mdash;How could she know he was being hounded day and
night by an idea, and that he was striving to place her
between the idea and himself? striving to stifle his eyes
and ears with her, to cram himself with her, to the
exclusion of all else. How should she guess that he
dared not love her little, lest her presence should prove
too feeble for its purpose; dared not love her much,
because of the hard bite in a man’s voice saying: “At
the height is the time to cut with any credit, my lad!”...
Why, then the more he loaded Letty with his
tenderness, the nearer he brought their passion to the
height where&mdash;&mdash;But he dared not love her less, nor
yet more.</p>

<p>Sebastian had not been near Stuart, since the latter
had, hornet-wise, stung his brain to a veritable madness
of thought. Stung, and stung again, and left the sting
within. Sebastian hated Stuart,&mdash;and Lord! how
one <em>could</em> hate a man who was capable of such ruthless
brutality as to treat love like some luxuriant but
dangerous growth; cut it away for the sake of ... of
what? This was where Sebastian always lost the idea;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
could sense it, indeed, far-off, taunting him for his lack
of understanding:</p>

<p>“You’re not big enough. Not big enough.”</p>

<p>“He’s not human. Not human,” the boy would shout
in reply.</p>

<p>He had perpetual nightmares of killing Stuart;
actually hacking at him with a knife; searching for
some vulnerable spot. But the blade would rebound
against a hard invisible resistance.... The nightmare
recurred again and again, tiring Sebastian, wearing
him to tatters, with its frenzied futility.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Ooo! light a match, Sebastian; it’s so dark,”
cried Letty, as the front door yielded to her timid
pressure.</p>

<p>The blue flicker betrayed the interior of the house as
quite new, smelling strongly of paint, completely
devoid of furniture; the walls unpapered; the floors
sonorous to the tramp of feet. Some boards and pails
lying about, and a candle-end stuck into a bottle on the
chimney-piece, betokened that the workmen were still
employed there during the daytime.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Sebastian, watching with considerable
amusement, as Letty, candle in hand, peeped into all
the bare echoing apartments, evidently seeing in them
far more than was apparent to the male eye. “Will it
do for us? Which is to be my study?”</p>

<p>Solemnly she led him into what might have been a
fair-sized cupboard.</p>

<p>“I protest!” cried Sebastian wrathfully. “You’re
just a tyrant. <em>This</em> shall be my study.” And he
planted himself firmly in the very largest room of all.</p>

<p>“The drawing-room, of course,” Letty contradicted,
her voice holding vistas of many ‘At Home days.’
“And I can’t have your dirty boots all over the pink
carpet. Oh, Sebastian, let’s pretend, a bit in each
room, that we’re already living here; just to see what
you’re like in a house of your own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>They began their game in a phantom-ridden dining-room;
at an imaginary breakfast-table.</p>

<p>“Lettice,” angrily, “this is the fifth bill I’ve had for
rose chintz. You’ve had enough rose chintz to make a
canopy for Hampstead Heath.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sebastian, and I’ve only covered three tiny
little cushions for your study. I do think you’re
ungrateful.”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you sixty times I won’t have cushions in
my study.”</p>

<p>“I’m only trying to make you comfortable.”</p>

<p>... A Vision, fading into the cold blue frosts that
lay beyond comfort or cushions.... He had chosen.
Not for him, the Vision. Another man had been
stronger, pursued it and held it....</p>

<p>“Now you’re working hard at your desk,” commanded
Letty, passing into the room behind. “And I
come in and disturb you. I want to test your temper.”</p>

<p>“Seek not to know what the gods have in their mercy
hidden,” laughed Sebastian, giving her the candle; she
went into the passage, and shut the door on him; for
an instant he was alone in the thick blackness.</p>

<p>... But he liked these stark naked rooms with their
wide wash of window. What sort of an appearance
would they present when furnished in a blend of
Johnsonese and his own æstheticism? Letty, he knew,
liked cheerful colours and a litter of knick-knacks&mdash;hateful
word, knick-knacks&mdash;one would fall over them&mdash;they
stood on rickety tables. He was beginning also to
dislike his own previous notions about schemes and
harmonies of decoration. They spread a cloying
smoothness over his mind, fretting for harsher salter
relief.... The idea was catching him again, here in
the draughty dark.... In a panic he stumbled to the
door, calling out her name: “Letty! Letty!”...</p>

<p>She entered with the candle:</p>

<p>“Darling, I’m so sorry to disturb you, but dinner is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
getting cold on the table. Sarah rang the gong three
times,” reproachfully.</p>

<p>He remembered the game, then; and with an
affectation of irritability, consigned Sarah and the
gong both to the devil.</p>

<p>“Sebastian, you really must not use such language,
even if you are busy.” She came up behind him, and
put her arms round his neck. “Say you’re sorry!”</p>

<p>“You’ve smudged the page.”</p>

<p>“Say you’re sorry!”</p>

<p>&mdash;The game led them upstairs, to the bedrooms.</p>

<p>“Now it’s my turn to be inside,” suggested Letty.
“You’ve come home late, oh, horribly late; and I’ve
been waiting up for you.”</p>

<p>“I seem to have a pretty rotten character altogether
in this show,” Sebastian objected. “What about you
coming home late?”</p>

<p>“Wives don’t,” said Letty and a lovely colour
flooded her face at the word she had unwittingly let slip.</p>

<p>He smiled. “Don’t they? All right, then we’ll both
be coming home late; I refuse to be a prodigal, for you
to bully me. We’ve been out together, Letty darling,
and you’re dead tired; I think I have to carry you
upstairs.” He strode ahead, and placed the candle on
the window-sill of the front first-floor room. Then, his
hands free, returned for his burden.</p>

<p>“Sebastian, you’re crushing me....”</p>

<p>“Let me undress you, you sleepy baby. Sit down
while I pull the combs out of your hair ... what soft
light masses ... like burying one’s hands in a snow-drift
only it’s warm ... warm. Did you enjoy
yourself, dancing with me to-night?”</p>

<p>“It was glorious; I’d rather waltz with you than
anyone, Sebastian.”</p>

<p>“Even though I’m only your husband?”</p>

<p>A hush. While the spearhead of flame spun fantastic
humped shadows over the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>... “What are you doing?” her voice was low as
a lullaby.</p>

<p>“Taking off your absurd shoes, sweet. No, you’re
not to do a thing for yourself; what am I here for?”</p>

<p>“To love me,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“To love you, Letty? Oh, Letty, it’s good to come
home like this, to our own house. Drowsy little girl, you
can shut your eyes now&mdash;<span class="lock">now&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>&mdash;And now the room had miraculously furnished
itself; long mirrors reflecting the silver on the toilet-table;
great dark flowers patterned on the walls; in a
recess, the shadowy blue gleam of a satin quilt, the
twinkle of brass knobs.... The whole drear abode
seemed suddenly astir with movement, as though their
duet had quickened to life each chamber as they passed
through. Somebody was singing overhead&mdash;empty
hearths had burst into a glow&mdash;footsteps ran up and
down the lit <span class="lock">stairs&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Letty!”</p>

<p>... Gone, that bleak vision which had tormented
him. Vision which sometimes took the shape of a lean
figure running, always running, against the wind.
Triumphantly Sebastian recognized that it had lost its
power with him; he had succeeded in shutting it out&mdash;shutting
it out, please God, for always....</p>

<p>“Letty! Letty!”</p>

<p>Her name was the talisman; and her fragrance....</p>

<p>&mdash;“Sebastian dear, it’s time to go home, isn’t it?
I’m just a wee bit cold.”</p>

<p>So they left behind them the empty house; and very
close together, walked back to Turnham Green. As they
drew near the gate of Town House, a familiar figure
loomed in sight from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Luke; been climbing the railway bank
again?”</p>

<p>“No,” disgustedly; he had forsworn these childish
pastimes fully two years ago. “I was just hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
about. Mater’s gone over to the Baker woman; I saw
her cross the road.”</p>

<p>“Here she is,” cried Letty, as Mrs. Johnson joined
them, with a cheery: “Well, children, had a nice
afternoon, all of you? Coming in to have a bit of
supper with us, Sebastian?”</p>

<p>He hesitated. “Mr. <span class="lock">Johnson&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“He’ll be delighted,” his wife promised. And indeed,
Mr. Johnson’s amiability over the roast mutton was a
thing to be remembered. The visit of Mr. Levi, senior,
was not mentioned; but the marvelling lovers were
informed they might fix their wedding-day for the near
future, and formally announce the date at dinner on
Christmas Day.</p>

<p>“Four o’clock,” Mrs. Johnson reminded Sebastian.
“We always start dinner at four on Christmas day, and
go on just as long as ever we like.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you take much breakfast, my boy,” put
in Mr. Johnson; “just nibble at a bit o’ dry toast. For
I warn you, you’ll need every bit of your appetite
later on.”</p>

<h3 class="break">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE DISCIPLE</span></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Christmas comes but once a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it comes it brings good cheer!”<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Granpa Cubitt’s sally was received with
hearty cheers. And Luke whispered to Jinny:
“He’s only starting now; you don’t know
Granpa. He can make verses about anybody, jump up
and make ’em. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>“<em>Does</em> it, though?” questioned Tommy Cox, à propos
of Christmas and good cheer. The invited guests, complete
in number, had been waiting in the drawing-room
since five minutes to four,&mdash;and now it was eight
minutes past, and no dinner had as yet been announced.
“I tell you what,” continued Tommy disconsolately;
“I believe Mrs. J. has humbugged us over turkey and
plum-pudding; and brought us all here to starve us to
death, just to show there’s no ill-feeling. Oooo!
Muvver! Don’t want to be a skelington!” And he
plumped himself down on the sofa, and with knuckles
screwed into his eyes, pretended to floods of bitter weeping.</p>

<p>Granpa whispered to Letty: “What is that young
man’s name, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Tommy Cox, Granpa.”</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, Granpa pointed with one finger
towards the blubbering youth; and, lifting the other
hand to enjoin silence, delivered himself of his first
impromptu of the evening:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Little Tommy Cox-o<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying for his Oxo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall we give him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Xmas box-o!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>
<p>“Now then, you young ladies, there’s a chance for
you!”</p>

<p>Amid shouts of laughter, and “Bravo, Granpa!”
Jinny ran forward, and with all her strength, smote
Tommy upon the ear.</p>

<p>“A Xmas box-o!” she chanted triumphantly. And
was only delivered from Tommy’s vengeance, by the
timely appearance of Mrs. Johnson in the doorway.
With quiet exaltation, she trumpeted forth the single
word:</p>

<p>“Dinner.”</p>

<p>At once a hush fell upon the company. A hush of
relief and expectation and a sense of the solemn rite
unto which they were summoned. Mr. Johnson led the
way to the dining-room, Aunt Lou panting upon his
arm. Granpa followed with Mrs. Baker; and there
ensued a real difficulty in getting them past the threshold,
above which dangled a large bunch of mistletoe.
Mrs. Johnson had purposely thrown the two together,
as Milly Baker never took offence at a bit of fun, “and
really, with father, you never know what he’ll be up to!”
The next pair, Tommy Cox and Vi Baker, were a
carefully-thought-out blend of merriment and sorrow;
Vi had taken to drooping her head and refusing comfort,
since she had given Ernie the chuck, and&mdash;“If Tommy
can’t cheer her up, I don’t know who can!” reflected
the hostess of the occasion. Sebastian and Letty were
coupled as a matter of course; and Luke and Jinny.
Mrs. Johnson herself brought up the rear with Balaam
Atkins, who under a neatly dressed and well-bred
exterior, concealed a heart that still beat faithfully for
Letty. He did not know yet that she was formally
betrothed to another; and Mrs. Johnson was sorry for
him, aware that the blow would descend within the
hour; she determined to make it her business that he
should eat a good meal, believing that trouble always
falls hardest on an empty stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>A thrill and a gasp ran round the assembly at first
sight of the festive board, decorated profusely with
holly and evergreens, and connected with the chandelier
by trails of smilax. Red and blue and green crackers
glittered in upright threes, like small bivouac fires; or
lay scattered flat between the plentiful dishes of almonds
and raisins and chocolates. On every lady’s name-card,
Letty had tastefully painted a spray of holly, with
a suitable sentiment attached; and on every gentleman’s,
a robin redbreast. The glistening napkins were
folded into boat-shapes, each beside a formidable array
of glasses and tumblers, expressive of much conviviality
to come. A miniature fir tree occupied the
proud position of centre-piece, gaily bedecked with
flags. Mrs. Johnson had spent much care and time on
the arrangement of her table, and wore an expression
of majestic geniality while her guests applauded, and,
still with that touch of awe upon them, slid into their
appointed places.</p>

<p>The soup was brought in, and doled out. Then arose
a squeal from Jinny:</p>

<p>“Oo-er! my shoe!” she had been attempting to
attract the attention of Luke, who, through some
shuffling of seats, sat opposite instead of beside her.
In an instant, Tommy Cox was underneath the table,
disporting himself mightily among the slippers easily
detachable, and continually bringing one up in his
mouth, for Jinny’s inspection&mdash;“No, Tommy, no;
mine’s a bronze one; that’s Vi’s!” And giggles from
a rapidly brightening Violet Baker: “Well, I never!
You have a sauce! Put it back where you found it,
this very minute.”</p>

<p>Granpa cleared his throat impressively:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Young man, you are much too bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll have the lady catching cold!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“How you do it, all of a sudden like that, beats me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
said Mrs. Baker admiringly. “Why, you’re quite a
poet.”</p>

<p>Bang! went the first cracker, between Aunt Lou and
her brother-in-law Mr. Johnson. And “Hooray!”
cried Luke and Jinny in unison, taking this for permission
to demolish the bivouacs, and start pulling
across the table.</p>

<p>“Not till dessert, Luke. Put those crackers back at
once. Matthew, I’m ashamed of you, setting such an
example.”</p>

<p>“I can’t wait! I can’t wait!” bellowed Tommy the
Humorist, holding a cracker to each eye, and squinting
through, to find out what was inside.</p>

<p>“There’s beef for whoever wants it,” announced the
carver, flourishing the knife over a prime large turkey.</p>

<p>Half-way through his portion of the bird&mdash;and a
well-heaped-up portion too,&mdash;Granpa thought it about
time that Sebastian and Letty should be brought into
prominence. Enjoining silence, as he always did before
casting his pearls, he sipped his claret, coughed and
choked several times, waggled an arch and shining
head, and spouted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I can see a red-haired lover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who’s squeezing his best girl’s hand under the table cover.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not think I’ve need to name him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all I can say is: I don’t blame him.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Granpa! how can you?” cried Letty, confused
and blushing; “I wasn’t,&mdash;I mean, he wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Bless them ... dear innocent things ...” murmured
Mrs. Baker, smoothing down the front of her prune-coloured
silk wrappings and excrescences and fermentations.
She was fearfully and wonderfully clad, this
Xmas Day. Aunt Lou eyed her with suspicion. Aunt
Lou considered Granpa not too old to make an old fool
of himself. She was the only spinster daughter, a rosy
bouncing lady, who wasn’t likely to stand a stepmother
being put over <em>her</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>Sebastian laughed hilariously at Granpa’s joke; and
continued laughing, even after the general mirth had
died down. Letty thought she’d never seen him so
lively; no, nor yet so handsome, dark eyes flaming in a
dead-white face, lips wine-red and feverish, hair a
ruffled auburn halo. “He’s like a god; he’s glorious,”
thought Letty; and turned, girl-like, to Balaam Atkins
on her other side, that she might compare him disparagingly
with Sebastian.</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins murmured: “I don’t blame him either,
Miss Letty,”&mdash;and suddenly she felt sorry for her discarded
swain, who really was just the sort of man to
have made her happy, with his neat normal ideas, and
neat clothes, and neat bank-balance, and neat fair
features. Sebastian might have resembled a god, but
Balaam Atkins was simply a cut-out model of a good
husband ... and did not contrast so very unfavourably
after all.</p>

<p>With the entrance of the lit plum pudding, flanked on
one side by the mince-pies, on the other by a very
yellow trifle (not free from a faint suspicion of Bird’s
custard powder), the last traces of restraint disappeared
from the party. Jinny, quite forgetting such everyday
things as manners, quite forgetting she wore her best
pink dress with the Irish lace collar, sprang on to her
chair, waved her spoon, and clamoured to be served
first, before the leaping fires went out. Indulgently,
because she was the youngest present, her wish was
granted.</p>

<p>“Greedy pig!” cried Luke. And: “Jea-lous!”
sang back Jinny, emulating the fire-eater’s celebrated
act.</p>

<p>A few minutes later: “Mrs. Baker’s got the <em>twins</em>!”
shrieked Tommy Cox, in an ecstasy of delight, snatching
from that lady’s plate the linked china dolls, and
dangling them aloft for the world to see.</p>

<p>“I believe she did it on purpose,” muttered Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Lou disgustedly. While Granpa chanted amorously to
his giggling wriggling neighbour:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, Baker’s twins!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It ain’t no use tryin’ to gobble up your sins!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We all can spot ’em,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonder how you got ’em!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Father!!!” Mrs. Johnson had overheard, and
was shocked beyond measure at her wicked old
parent.</p>

<p>Jinny had the wedding-ring; and would much have
preferred the threepenny-bit, which fell to Mr. Johnson’s
share; wiping and pocketing the coin, he remarked
waggishly that it would help pay for this dinner, which,
as it was, had left him a Ruined Man. And then Aunt
Lou took offence, and said there were plenty of invitations
just as good that she and her father might have
accepted if they’d known Matthew grudged them a
morsel of bird and a fragment of pudding; and even if
he only said it in fun, it wasn’t at all funny to make
one’s guests feel uncomfortable, especially at Yuletide,
which ought to be a season of peace-on-earth goodwill-to-men.
Then Mr. Johnson apologized; and Aunt
Lou, softened, wept a little, was pressed to a
second helping of plum-pudding, and all was harmony
again.</p>

<p>Violet Baker had found the old maid’s thimble under
her spoon, but managed to conceal it; Tommy Cox
was being very attentive, and there was no sense in
putting him off from the start, so to speak.</p>

<p>At last, when the pudding-plates were removed, and
replaced by mounds of oranges and figs and dates; when
port gleamed duskily in every glass, and the nut-crackers
were freely circulating, Mrs. Johnson gave the anxiously
awaited signal for the crackers to be pulled. Then
indeed, pandemonium reached its height; then indeed,
every head, old and young, was drunkenly crowned by
paper cap or bonnet; and: bang! bang! bang! the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
squibs exploded up and down the table. The cloth was
one glittering litter of green and red transparency, all
mixed up with the orange-peel and silver paper. Luke
and Jinny had each a musical instrument at their lips,
and squeaked and squawked ceaselessly, their cheeks
blown out and purple with the exertion. Vi Baker and
Tommy Cox had their heads very close together over
a finger-bowl, in which they were experimenting with
those Japanese puzzles that open out in water; his arm
was around her waist; and she, transported by the
hectic screaming excitement of Xmas, was content to
leave it there. Granpa, who had donned a rakish gilt
crown, between whose spikes one could glimpse the gas-light
reflected in the naked polish of his cranium, was
busy making a collection of mottoes, riddles and sentimental
verse, from the crackers, and reading them aloud.
From the kitchen below, quavered the third repetition
of “Good King Wenceslas.” Balaam Atkins whispered
to Letty, in a tone pregnant of mournful meaning: “I
wonder&mdash;if I might venture&mdash;to ask you&mdash;to pull with
me, Miss Letty?”&mdash;Then, utterly abashed, realized
what construction might have been put upon his
innocent demand; and dropped the cracker, and went
down after it, and remained obliterated for quite a
period of time. And Mrs. Baker, wearing a washer-woman’s
bonnet, which had an air strangely and
horribly appropriate, was dancing,&mdash;yes, actually
dancing, with Aunt Lou Cubitt; all enmity forgotten
in the sudden discovery that forty years ago they had
met at the same terpsichorean school, where little girls
in frilled pantaloons learnt to jig and reel and polka.&mdash;And:
“Do you remember the Bluebell Schottische?”
cried Aunt Lou; which led to the pleasing exhibition
just mentioned, of two middle-aged ladies gathering up
their skirts, and prancing and twirling down the narrow
space of the room between the wall and the row of
chairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>“I used to be light as a fairy,” panted Mrs. Baker,
regaining her seat.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Johnson exchanged a mute dialogue of
glances, which might be curtly translated as: “When?”
“Now.” And Mr. Johnson, glass in hand, rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” cried Tommy Cox, thumping
on the table.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;and friends,” began Mr.
Johnson, making a fine distinction. “I must hurry up
with what I’m going to say, because I can see the gas
is goin’ down, and I haven’t got a penny for the metre&mdash;leave
alone for the meat!” Here he made a great
show of being terrified of Aunt Lou’s disapproval; but
she, mellowed by port, merely smiled benignly; and
he went on: “And I wouldn’t like to talk to you in
the dark, my friends, and lose sight of your beaming
faces wreathed in happy smiles, as my pal Will
Shakespeare once said,&mdash;or was it Granpa Cubitt?
’Pon my word, I’m getting mixed with all these
poets.”</p>

<p>Whereat there was great applause, and Granpa was
patted vigorously on the back.</p>

<p>“Who has added so richly to the evening’s entertainment,”
said Mr. Johnson, in an inspired sentence all by
itself. Then he recommenced:</p>

<p>“I think I can say, in which my wife joins me,”
(cheers) “that nowhere in England, no, nor yet anywhere
else, has a merrier party sat round any table,
nor had a merrier Xmas.” (Chorus of assent.) “So
may you all enjoy the best of luck till we meet over our
next plum-pudding.”</p>

<p>&mdash;A groan from Jinny, to whom the thought was
agony. And, amid the cheering and tattoo of feet
which followed the host’s oratory, Balaam Atkins,
suddenly coming to the fore, begged to propose a toast
to The Ladies. Leave being vociferously given, he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
utterance, in precise, rather lugubrious tones, to the
following rollicking bit of sentiment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Your eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your lips!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lips!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes have met!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our lip&mdash;not yet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s hoping!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then he sat down again.</p>

<p>“Here’s hoping!” cried Tommy Cox, clinking glasses
with Vi Baker, and then with every other lady present.
The rest of the gentlemen gallantly followed suit.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson had remained on his feet, to intimate
that he had not yet finished what he had to say. A
meaning smile signified that something of importance
lay behind his silence. So, by unanimous consent,
voices were hushed to allow him to proceed.</p>

<p>“I am profiting of the festive occasion,” spoke Mr.
Johnson, “and may I be propheting truly” (interval
for laughter; and for the pun to be explained to Aunt
Lou, who was almost asleep), “to make an announcement
that to some of you will be a surprise, and to
some won’t. It’s this: Ladies and gentlemen, I ask
you to fill your glasses and drink to the engagement
of my only daughter with Mr. Sebastian Levi, here
present.”</p>

<p>The enthusiasm was tremendous. Vi Baker came
round the table to embrace her friend; Aunt Lou
collapsed from sheer astonishment, and was heard
vociferating that she had never dreamt of such a thing.
Granpa composed an appropriate rhyme&mdash;threw it off
with no trouble at all&mdash;which was forever lost to the
world, because Jinny and Tommy Cox were relieving
their overcharged feelings in a prolonged bout of hip-pip-pip-hurrahs!
And Balaam Atkins took the news
like the gentleman he was, and with a terrific effort,
managed to ejaculate: “I hope you will be very, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
happy, Miss Letty.” But Letty unfortunately did not
hear him, in the general hubbub surrounding her.</p>

<p>“Before calling on my future son-in-law for a reply,”
shouted Mr. Johnson, over the tumult, “I want to
make him a little Christmas-box. I want to make it
here, in front of you all. It’s the custom of the country,
and I speak of the best country in the world, which is
England” (“Rule Britannia!” yelled Tommy), “that
the lady shall name the day. Well, I’m going to reverse
that process. I’m a bold man, and I’m going to give
Mrs. Grundy a rouser. Me and my wife and my daughter
are going to sit mum, while the bridegroom now fixes
the date of the wedding. It may be that he’ll say in a
month; or it may be that he’ll get scared of the noose of
matrimony&mdash;or shall I call it the noose-ance?” (loud
laughter) “and plead for six months’ extension of liberty.
Or it may be he’ll say to-morrow,&mdash;one never can tell
with these fiery-headed young chaps how much delay
they can stand!” (more laughter) “I just hope he’ll
remember that young ladies need a little time to get
together their frillies,&mdash;at least, so I’ve been told.”
(“Go on! as if you didn’t know!” from Mrs. Baker,
rather over-excited.) “Sebastian, my boy, it’s up to
you.” Mr. Johnson sat down.</p>

<p>Amid acclamation, Sebastian was hauled to his feet.
Letty gave his hand an encouraging squeeze.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For he’s a jolly good fel-low!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>started Tommy Cox; in a burst of gruff enthusiasm,
Luke joined in; and then the rest of the company.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“&mdash;And so say all of us!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>... They were silent now, waiting for Sebastian.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Past the heat and the uproar and the odour of food,
past the coarse laughter and good-humoured jokes, the
grinning capped faces, and the disorderly table, Sebastian
glimpsed it clearly, his Vision ... never before as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
clearly: a lean stripped figure, striving, battling, forcing
itself against the rushing winds of earth; hands clenched,
jaw pushed forward ... yes, surely it was Stuart’s face
he saw!</p>

<p>&mdash;These others should share the vision with him. He
was about to sacrifice to it&mdash;these others should understand
why. He knew now to what point he had been
goaded through all the sweetness of the past weeks,
through all the gabble and gobble of the past hour. He
knew. He wasn’t going to flinch. Boring a hole in the
wind with the thrust of one’s own body.... If Stuart
could do it, he could.</p>



<p class="tbpara">The first notes of his voice startled his hearers; it
seemed pitched somehow in the wrong key; neither
jocular nor embarrassed:</p>

<p>“I can’t fix a day for the wedding, as Mr. Johnson
has asked me to. I&mdash;there won’t be a wedding. My
engagement with Letty is broken off.”</p>



<p class="tbpara">&mdash;Suddenly he wanted to laugh. Granpa’s face, just
opposite, looked so funny in its dropped amazement,
the gilt crown at a crooked angle on the shining poll....
Everyone’s face was funny&mdash;staring&mdash;staring&mdash;round
eyes and open mouths wherever he looked&mdash;like
waxworks. Letty ... well, Letty was beside him. He
need not see her unless he turned his head....</p>



<p class="tbpara">“You all think me quite mad,” Sebastian went on,
after a pause. “Well, and I think you mad, all of you.
I’ve been thinking so all through dinner. Because you
can’t see anything beyond the dining-room table, and
what’s on it. If I married Letty, I should have to sit
for the rest of my life at a dining-room table, looking at
the food. It would be warm and comfortable and satisfying,
and in time I should grow as mad as you. I very
nearly did. But I’m sane now&mdash;and I’m bitten with the
horror of getting all one wants, and going on getting it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and not wanting any more. Giving up Letty now, I
shall want her my whole life long ... for I love her&mdash;do
you understand that? Of course, you think one
shouldn’t speak of love except to be funny about it&mdash;but
you’ve got to realize that I love her, every bit of
her; that I love her, and I’m giving her up&mdash;and oh,
God! how it hurts.... How good that it should
hurt....”</p>

<p>He bowed his face on to his hands, unable for an
instant to grapple with the swift salt cruelty of self-torment.
From beside him, came the sound of soft
weeping. There was to be no splendid help from Letty,
in his renunciation; quite simply, she laid her head
down on her arms and sobbed, because she didn’t know
what was the matter with Sebastian,&mdash;oh, what was
the matter with him, that he should be so unkind?</p>

<p>Luke was gazing, wide-eyed, mouth gaping; he had
not understood a single word of Sebastian’s discourse,
but, nevertheless, his soul was one flame of admiration.
A half-fearful hope of happiness was stiffening the limp
spirit of Balaam Atkins. But Mr. Johnson, on whose
brow a ponderous wrath had gathered, burst out,
almost apoplectic with rage:</p>

<p>“Let me tell you, sir, that if you’re not a lunatic,
you’re a blackguard. You’re behaving like a blackguard!”</p>

<p>Sebastian raised his head: “I’ve told you that I
want her,” he cried fiercely; “is that behaving like a
blackguard, not to take what you want?&mdash;But you’re
thick, every one of you; thick with food and drink.
Can’t you get clear of your flesh for a moment, and get a
grip of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash; Look here, this is neither my creed
nor my credit: it’s another man’s ... he’s <em>done</em> it, I
tell you&mdash;stripped himself of love, because it’s better to
desire than to possess. If you’re strong enough.... If
you’re strong enough. I gave up my solid income, and
my solid position in the world,&mdash;didn’t that show you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
I must have had some keener leaner ideal than just
welfare? Or did you merely think me possessed?...
But it’s splendid, I tell you, to be possessed; possessed
by the truth; driven by it&mdash;hounded&mdash;tortured&mdash;till
you cast away all goods, all ties,&mdash;run a race against your
own luck&mdash;outstrip your own luck&mdash;just for the fun of it&mdash;throw
off the bondage ... bondage of great deeds....”</p>

<p>He was repeating Stuart’s catch-phrases now; flinging
them out mechanically, hoping they would sting
some blind understanding, where his own eloquence had
failed.</p>

<p>And then his mood changed, as he discovered it didn’t
matter if these people understood or not; he had done
his part; done what Stuart Heron had done before
him: cut away love....</p>

<p>&mdash;“That the memory of love shall be like a sword-blade,”
he muttered half-aloud; but the words meant
nothing&mdash;they tasted dry. Letty’s sobs were each a
separate pang in his heart. The Vision, having spurred
him to the culminating burst of exaltation, now deserted
him altogether. He did not know any more for what
strange reasons he had performed this strange act. But
since the master knew, that was sufficient; the disciple
was content to follow blindly. He would go now and
lay his shattered world as a tribute at Stuart’s feet ...
where he had already laid his father’s disappointment ...
his own ambitions. His shattered world at Stuart’s feet.</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair, and stumbled to the door.
Nobody tried to stop him. He had paralysed the happy
Christmas party, so that no sound broke through the
leaden silence ... even Letty was quiet now. Sebastian
groped among the overcoats hanging from the hall
rack&mdash;so many overcoats&mdash;he was quite incapable of
recognizing his own. Did it matter, after all? But
still he took down first one and then another from their
pegs, and replaced them, stifled by the musty folds.
A wreath of holly, which encircled the mirror set in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
rack, tumbled to the ground. Sebastian picked it up,
stood in a dazed fashion, the thorns pricking his fingers:
was there no end to the damage he was doing these
people’s Yule?</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson led her weeping daughter from the
dining-room, and up the stairs. They passed Sebastian
as if he did not exist.</p>

<p>... “Oh, mother, how could he, in front of them all,
say that he didn’t love me any more?”...</p>

<p>So much for Letty’s comprehension of motive. Sebastian
laughed hysterically, and banged the hall door
behind him. Half-way up the road, he looked back, and
saw Luke signalling to him from the gate. He went on.
Could not be bothered with the boy. Stuart&mdash;he was
going to Stuart.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Disappointedly, Luke turned back into the house.
On the threshold he was met by Jinny:</p>

<p>“Everybody’s so horrid. Wasn’t he a beast to spoil
all our fun? Luke, do let’s get away from everybody
for a bit, till they’ve calmed down. I’ve bagged some
chocs from the table.” She displayed them, moist and
brown, clenched in her hot hands. She looked very
pretty, in her bright pink dress and coral beads. Luke
surveyed her a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t want any chocs. And I’m not ever going to
see you again, Jinny, old girl. At least, not if I can help
it”; he remembered the proximity of her dwelling.</p>

<p>Jinny dropped her spoils; and, crimson with anger
and surprise, gasped out:</p>

<p>“Well I never! You potty <em>too</em>!”</p>

<p>“No,” retorted Luke, kicking with his foot against
the top step, “I’m not potty, and nor’s he. You girls
don’t understand, that’s all. There are things we can
do better without you. Things!” he repeated darkly,
wondering the while what they were. “Girls are
<span class="lock">soft&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re not soft. Soft yourself!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that sort of soft. And the more we
care for you, the finer it is of us to break with you.” He
had grasped this much from Sebastian’s outburst. “So
you see, <span class="lock">Jinny&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>But Jinny was neither as submissive as Letty, nor as
responsive as Peter, under similar treatment.</p>

<p>“Break with me, indeed!” tossing her curls indignantly,
while the big pink satin bow at the nape of her
neck, perked out in aggressive sympathy; “well, you
<em>have</em> got a cheek on you, Luke Johnson. Got to be on
with a girl before you’re off with her, <em>I</em>’ve always heard.
And you were never on with me, that I’m jolly well
sure. No, nor likely to be,&mdash;a great gawky lumpy-faced
boy!”</p>

<p>She picked up her coat, which was lying in a crumpled
heap at the foot of the hall-stand, and flouncing past her
stricken sweetheart, marched down the four steps of
Town House, and up the four steps of Arcadia, next
door.</p>

<p>&mdash;Luke made a sudden forward dive over the stone
parapet that divided them, and caught Jinny awkwardly
by her skirt:</p>

<p>“Let me go!” she twisted round, that he might not
see the tears which scalded her eyes.</p>

<p>“Jinny,” his voice was low; “it’s&mdash;I was only joking,
y’know. It’s all right about the panto to-morrow, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Not so sure.”</p>

<p>“Jinny!”</p>

<p>“Oh,&mdash;I suppose so!” she detached herself from his
grasp, and vanished indoors.</p>



<p class="tbpara">Luke had not been able to pull it off, after all. Not
quite.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>




<h3 class="break">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">THE MASTER</span></h3>


<p>“Mr. Heron is dressing, sir.” The butler at
Careton House Terrace looked with some
disfavour at the dishevelled wild-eyed young
man, who at 7 p.m. on Christmas Day, rang such
frenzied peals at the bell, and asked for the son of the
house, in such strange husky tones. It wasn’t usual;
and the butler’s reply contained a tinge of severity
mingled with its formal respect.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up to him.” Brushing past the astonished
retainer, Sebastian rushed up the two flights of stairs;
and, without knocking, entered Stuart’s bedroom.</p>

<p>Stuart, in evening-dress, was standing before the
mirror, and polishing his eyeglass. “You, Levi?
Why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Sebastian stood just within the door, limbs and tongue
alike paralysed of movement. There was so much&mdash;so
much he had need to say to Stuart: the words buzzed
and beat in his brain like swarms of hornets. All through
his headlong passage through the deserted streets, he
had been working up and up to this moment. He
wanted to shout what he had done, and how he had
done it; he wanted to assure Stuart over and over
again that he regretted nothing, no, not even Letty;
that he was grateful to the master for rescuing him
from happiness, pointing out to him the cold path
among the stars.... Stars? but they weren’t cold;
they were throbbing hot&mdash;green and blue and red&mdash;like
the glistening paper that was wrapped around a cracker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
... and they were jigging and squibbing and somersaulting
in front of his eyes&mdash;tumbling wheeling stars
... or were they sobs? Ridiculous! one couldn’t see
sobs.... Somebody had been sobbing lately, he
knew....</p>

<p>He took an uncertain step forward, held out his hands
towards Stuart,&mdash;then reeled over into a chair, head
dropped on to his arms.... He had to thank Stuart&mdash;was
thanking him now&mdash;heard his own voice babbling
the phrase over and over again.... “Curse you....
Curse you....”</p>

<p>He had not meant to say it. He had meant to say
exactly the contrary: “I’ve done what you once did;
you showed me the way; you&mdash;&mdash;” But things were
happening to him now totally beyond his own volition.
The exultation of his deed accomplished transported
him, maddened him, to strange contortions of speech,
outside all reason:</p>

<p>“Curse you.... Curse you....”</p>



<p class="tbpara">In silence Stuart stood looking down upon the boy.
He guessed what had happened; had anticipated, ever
since their last conversation, that Sebastian would
come bursting in upon him, to relate that he had
smashed with Letty. It was better so; the two would
never have understood each other rightly. And yet&mdash;wasn’t
it a pity, after all, to have destroyed an idyll?
A sudden remorse swept over Stuart; and with it, an
awful desolation of uncertainty: What had he been
doing with other people’s lives?... His metaphysics
dropped away from under his feet, leaving him treading
upon a void. For one wont to be so quietly sanely self-confident,
the sensation was horrible. He could not
remain any longer where he was, in the same room
with ... with the wreckage. Stuart left Sebastian;
went slowly down, and into his study. He was entertaining
a large party of family and friends that evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
at the Carlton; was already due at the Restaurant;
felt disinclined to start. He strolled to the window,
and looked out; the street wore that blank forlorn
look which falls upon chimney-top and pavement on
Christmas Day. Only once before had Stuart been so
utterly miserable, so incomplete in himself, clutching
for some outside reassurance that he existed at all; he
had gone to Merle then, and laid his head in her lap,
and she had asked no questions. But now Merle was
on her honeymoon in France. And, besides, it was not
Merle he wanted....</p>

<p>He crossed the room to the telephone. Was there
any reason why he should not get what he wanted
most? Only his theory&mdash;slippery ball on the summit
of which he had insecurely balanced himself. It would
be rather fun to jump off his own theory, and kick it
away, hear it go bounding and bouncing on its course!
Great fun! argued leprechaun.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Trunk. 904 Thatch Lane.”</p>

<p>It took some time before the connection was established.
Stuart sat on the arm of a chair, and looked
hard at the receiver. Presently the whir of the bell
shrilled in his ear. It startled him, even though he was
waiting for it so intently.</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>... “Hello!” Evidently the maid at Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to Miss Kyndersley, please?”</p>

<p>It never struck him that she might be out. She would
not be out. That sort of thing had always happened
right for him and Peter.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. What name?”</p>

<p>“No name.”</p>

<p>After a pause, Peter’s voice:</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello&mdash;Peter!”</p>

<p>She knew at once. He could tell that by the silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
That was like Peter; she would not reply till in control
of her tumbled feelings.</p>

<p>At last: “A Merry Christmas to you, Stuart!”</p>

<p>Her mocking accent, in a vivid flash of memory,
brought her image to his mind, as he had first seen her:
Cavalier poise of the head; boyish figure wrapped close in
a bronze cloak, shimmering gold where the light caught
it, umber in its shadowy folds; a tingle about her
movements, as of some hazardous quest in the air. His
master-maid!... And what had he to do with loneliness
now?</p>

<p>&mdash;“Peter, I want to take you home from Euston to
Thatch Lane&mdash;to-night&mdash;at once. May I?”</p>

<p>A low gurgle of laughter:</p>

<p>“But, dear, I’m due in ten minutes at the Lorrimers’.
They have a party.”</p>

<p>“And I’m due since half an hour at the Carlton. I
have a party. Peter ... will you come?”</p>

<p>“To your party?”</p>

<p>“No. My God, no. Baldwin will look after all that.
To Euston?” Silence again.... He was sure she
had gone away from the receiver:</p>

<p>“Peter! Peter! Are you still there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Stuart.”</p>



<p class="tbpara">Quarter of an hour later, and his car was whirling
him through the grim portals of Euston Station. The
grey fogs clung thicker than ever about the great outer
hall. The porters moved about like hobgoblins in a
dream. Speechless and voiceless they all seemed, and
yet the vaulted roof echoed and re-echoed with ceaseless
hollow shouts. By dint of enquiries, Stuart found
out that the 5.17 from Leaford, four stations further
down the line than Thatch Lane, due at Euston since
6.20, had probably not yet started on its languid career,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and need certainly not be expected at Euston till somewhere
in the environment of nine o’clock. The giant
clock pointed with its hands to three minutes past
eight.</p>

<p>“That ull be the next h’in from Thatch Lane, sir.
We’re bound to be a bit h’unpunctual Christmas-time.
There’s the mails, sir. And people leavin’ their ’omes.
An’ it’s a bit thick on the line further down, maybe.
Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>Throughout his life, Stuart vowed he did ample
penance for his crowded sins, by this interminable
period of waiting. He had forgotten now all about
Sebastian; all about his remorse; the blanket of desolation
had lifted from his spirit. He was merely one
concentrated throb of impatience. Occasionally he
dogged station-masters or signals, in the hope that
these might be induced to render up their prey. Their
prey was the 5.17 from Leaford. But they were immutable.
Once he worked, feverishly, at an automatic
machine, inducing it to yield box after box of matches,
in order to feel that he could, of his own accord, make
something <em>move</em>, even clockwork. Ghostly trucks
clanked up and down the platforms; drifting wraiths
asked him if he knew when and where impossible
trains started for impossible places; he strove to give
them all the help in his power, in order to placate the
dark gods of Euston.</p>

<p>At twenty-five minutes past nine, the red eye of an
engine glimmered far down the stretching parallels of
steel; and Stuart was informed that this, in all probability,
was the Leaford 5.17. Not even now would the
porter commit himself to a certainty; this was the
season when freakish spirits controlled the great
terminus.</p>

<p>The linked cubes of light drew up beside the platform;
doors opened, and people tumbled forth, an ever
thickening crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;Then Stuart saw Peter. She was walking swiftly
in his direction. He moved forward to meet her.
Silently, side by side, they went on to the barrier.</p>

<p>“We must see at once about your train to Thatch
Lane,” said Stuart at last, in strictly matter-of-fact
tones.</p>

<p>She replied gravely: “Yes, we mustn’t miss it on
any account.” But her lips twitched a little at the
corners.</p>

<p>Stuart’s star, evidently again in working order,
manœuvred that the 7.41 to Leaford, stopping at
Thatch Lane, should be girding its loins for departure,
just as the pair strolled on to number four platform.
They found an empty first-class compartment. The
train still lingered; the guard seemed loth to wave his
green flag; toyed with it, instead, and exchanged light
badinage with the stoker. Stuart felt incapable of
uttering a word till they were actually moving. Only
the gathering speed could put an end to this intolerable
strain. He examined the coloured photographs above
the seats. The engine breathed heavily, crawled a
couple of inches.... Stuart’s nerves jumped with
relief!... then the 7.41 settled again into comfortable
lethargy. It was only twenty to ten.</p>

<p>“Are you most interested in cathedrals or waterfalls?”
came Peter’s cool voice, from the corner where
she had ensconced herself. Stuart continued a dogged
interest in the photographs. Cool?&mdash;he knew she was
aflame, even as he. But they could both maintain
their imperturbability ... for a few moments still.</p>

<p>After a little more coy reluctance, the engine decided
firmly that this really wouldn’t do! and with a jolt and
a shiver, tore headlong from the temptations of Euston,
into the spectral beyond.</p>

<p>Stuart turned and looked at Peter.... She held out
her hand:</p>

<p>“Give me a cigarette.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>Grimly he obeyed; and even shielded the match for
her. Twice, deliberately, she inhaled, and puffed out
the smoke. Then their eyes met again.... She rose,
and through the partially open window, tossed the
remainder of her cigarette. It fell away in a shower of
sparks. Her action snapped the invisible rod which
was holding them apart.... He crushed her against
him. They rocked slightly with the motion of the
train. Then, slowly, he loosened his grip. Her head
fell back, so that her eyes were half-veiled by their
lids. And he stammered:</p>

<p>“Your throat is as white as foam ... and curved ...
like the curve of a wave!” From some dim memory
the phrase had leapt into his mind, and he spoke it.</p>

<p>“Peter, I love you.”</p>

<p>“The love of a leprechaun?”</p>

<p>“No. The love of a man. A quite ordinary man....
Will you marry me, Peter?” he knelt crouching
beside her, where she bent down to him from her seat.</p>

<p>“Peter, I shall always love you ... now and for
ever and for all time. I want you near me, in my
house, close up to me, bearing my name. My wife ...
damn you, don’t laugh! I’m not pretending&mdash;I <em>am</em> an
ordinary man. I refuse to be treated any longer as a
freak. I want to go on a honeymoon with you, Peter,
to Paris and Italy, where all nice people go. I want to
be just happy. No; I want you to be happy. I’ll buy
you a ring, and introduce you to my mother, and
furnish a house with you, and give dinner-parties,
<span class="lock">and&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Stuart, are you mad?” she cried, aghast. For
Stuart to behave so sanely was indeed a most alarming
sign of madness in him.</p>

<p>“Will you marry me, Peter?”</p>

<p>“I might as well put on a hair-shirt for the rest of
my existence.” Then she looked down at the round
dark head tilted back on to her lap; met his elfish, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
strangely tender smile; and, with a tightening of love
which was almost painful in its intensity, tried to fix
the moment&mdash;this moment within sight and sound of
him&mdash;to stand for the blank moment which she knew
lay inevitably ahead of her. The girl had no illusions as
to the fate of those who link their happiness with
something not quite human. The last six months had
taught her. The memory of them was like black seas
rolling foamless on to a dark shore. When the next
theory seized him....</p>

<p>Politely she enquired after the last.</p>

<p>“I’ve rolled it down the hill,” Stuart confessed.
“But I’ve had enormous fun with it. I’ve sacrificed to
it, and I’ve argued against it&mdash;that was with Aureole
and Ber&mdash;&mdash;” he stopped just in time, and hastily
covered his blunder: “and I’ve dangled it in front of a
disciple, and I’ve treated it like a football. Really, a
theory is a most excellent occupation!” And then he
told her about Letty and Sebastian.</p>

<p>Peter listened thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“So they’ve broken away from each other, just as
we did?”</p>

<p>“Something like that. I don’t expect they accomplished
it as cleanly. Sebastian’s methods are inclined
to be messy or theatrical. In fact, it was he who
managed to put me off my ideas; he overdid them so
disgracefully. And I doubt if he ever took a firm and
logical grasp of them.”</p>

<p>“Then why&mdash;oh, Stuart, why didn’t you leave him
alone?”</p>

<p>Stuart knitted his brows. “It was a <em>good</em> theory,”
he said, in much the same tone as the Mad Hatter once
pleaded: “It was the <em>best</em> butter!”</p>

<p>“But you’ve doubled back on it now.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. So somebody’s got to prove it, if I don’t.
Hang it! one can’t leave theories lying loose about the
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m thinking of Letty,” said Peter softly, flooded by
pity for the girl now groping helplessly after her mate,
not understanding why she had been deprived of him.
She, Peter, had understood at the time&mdash;it hadn’t
been so hard for her. “Oh, poor Letty ... poor little
lovers....”</p>

<p>Stuart interrupted, rather uneasily: “She’ll marry a
bank clerk, and be grateful to me for the rest of her life.
Really and truly, Peter, I was trying to help them.
They’d have been so miserable together. People who
are blind, <em>must</em> be helped.”</p>

<p>&mdash;The train drew up with a jerk at a station. Bewildered
by this abrupt cessation to the speed at which
they had been hurled through streaming space, Stuart
scrambled to his feet. Grey fretting ghost-figures
hurried past their window. He watched them, himself
dreamily calm; it was inconceivable that anything
from the outer world could break through the enchantment
which held their compartment aloof and inviolate
from all intrusion. Nevertheless, an intrepid hand
suddenly clutched at the door-handle, turned it sharply,
called to someone behind: “Plenty of room in here!”&mdash;And,
before any preventive measures could be taken,
two large women collapsed on the seat opposite Stuart
and Peter.... And the train rushed on.</p>

<p>Stuart’s lips moved. If it were in prayer, then it was
prayer of a very perverted form.</p>

<p>And Peter wondered, despairingly, if these were real
females, or grotesque fiends sent by the night to torment
them. They seemed to her fancy, preternaturally
enormous. As never before, she craved now the bruise
of Stuart’s lips, hard as iron; the lean, strong grip of
his hands; tangible reassurance that he had indeed
come back to her. If she could hold him as though he
were a child, his head in the crook of her arm, if she
could soothe those restless quick-moving limbs of his
to a lulled content.... She glanced hopelessly at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
two large women eating belated mince-pies from a paper
bag. Then, in a low voice, asked Stuart if he had been
present at Merle’s wedding. She had read accounts of
it in the papers; it had been a magnificent function.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was there; so was the whole diplomatic
world, ministerial, <span class="lock">ambassadorial&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Never mind. Tell me about Jean de Cler.”</p>

<p>“He’s the right sort, I think,” Stuart granted handsomely.
“Grey at the temples, distinguished, chivalrous;
with that inborn ease of manner which marks the blue
blood of the ‘ancien régime’&mdash;or something of the
kind. He evidently adores Merle, and will spend his
life cherishing her.”</p>

<p>“And she? Does she want to be cherished?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “She can’t help liking
him&mdash;very much, I should say. And she’ll be in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</i> which suits her best. Probably she’ll think of
us sometimes, and be tormented&mdash;but she was never
quite a pirate, you know; she only wore the costume.
The wedding-dress suited her better; I’ve never seen
anyone look so beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Did you speak to her?”</p>

<p>“For one second I pressed near enough to offer my
congratulations.”</p>

<p>“In what form?”</p>

<p>“I said: ‘There was once a pig, Merle, who lived in
a sty in Cornwall.’ And she smiled.&mdash;‘There were once
two girls, Stuart, who sat in a trough that belonged to a
pig who lived in a sty in Cornwall.’ Then Madame des
Essarts wafted me out of the way; I believe she regards
me as an unhealthy influence.”</p>

<p>... “There were once two girls, Stuart&mdash;&mdash;” Peter
understood why Merle had made no sign, had not
invited her to the wedding. The jewel had definitely
accepted her casket lined with pink; dared not risk
the raising of the lid....</p>

<p>The large women had been listening with absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
interest to the account of the wedding. Now, as the
train slowed up again at the station before Thatch
Lane, they gathered together their belongings, and
departed.</p>



<p class="tbpara">For the two in their cramped galloping space of light,
the circle of enchantment joined again as though it had
never been snapped. The humid night whirled past
their window. Stuart bent towards the girl; took her
in his arms: “Lie still, dear,” ... and for the second
time Peter lay still; mind and body and soul, still.</p>

<p>And, sighing, she wished this journey were already
over&mdash;that already she were lying in bed&mdash;already
asleep&mdash;and already waking at dawn to the knowledge of
a world which again held Stuart.</p>

<p>There had been another dawn....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;“Because he did it ...” murmured the disciple.</p>

<p>“Mr. de Sélincourt has not only written what
will fascinate the mere lover of romance, but has
crystallised a philosophy of passion and love.”</p>

<p class="sig">
<cite>Daily Chronicle.</cite><br />
</p>

<p>“It is full of sincerity and ardour: it is flooded
with youth like a cold sunny morning, with intimate
friendliness like a firelit room at evening.”</p>

<p class="sig">
<cite>New Statesman.</cite><br />
</p>

<p>“She is so shrewdly and finely drawn [of
principal character] that she is as convincing as
she is adorable.”&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite></p>

<p>“Rarely has fiction given us such a complete
study of an elderly woman intellectually young.
Altogether a novel upon which the author may be
heartily congratulated.”&mdash;<cite>Daily Graphic.</cite></p>

<p>“Manly, wholesome and refreshing.”</p>

<p class="sig">
<cite>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite><br />
</p>

<p>“He offers you a steed and a star. And the star
is love and the steed is laughter.”&mdash;<cite>Observer.</cite></p>

<p>“An infinitely memorable, vivid portrait, young
as youth itself, with all youth’s generous fire.”</p>
